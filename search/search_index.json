EHRs are digital patient-centered records that make information securely available to authorized users. EHRs are intended to be operated by a healthcare practice or system and consolidate inputs by multiple providers within that system including physicians from differing specialties, nurses, and more that engage with a patient over the time they are receiving care. In an idealized implementation, an EHR may include all the key administrative clinical data relevant to that patient\u2019s care received through the health system. This includes demographics, progress notes, problems, medications, vital signs, past medical history, immunizations, laboratory data and radiology reports. These data may be in the form of both structured data (e.g., lab results) or unstructured data (e.g., clinical notes). In practice, even EHRs connected across hospital systems may not be well integrated, and information may not be harmonized. This situation can be made worse when an EHR system is customized in different settings (e.g., in different hospital systems, offices, etc.). Note Additionally, while initially a tool to facilitate electronic billing, an EHR system can increasingly go beyond standard clinical data collected in a provider\u2019s office and can be inclusive of a broader, patient-centric view of their care. This may include incorporating data from external care providers, as well as integrating with clinical decision support and other supplemental data sources to enhance an understanding of a patient\u2019s wellbeing. EHR Technical Architecture To better understand the data elements contained in an EHR, it is important to understand the technical architecture of an EHR system. This section describes the major architectural components of an EHR system, and the interactions between these components. EHR System Component Description User Interface The user interface (UI) is a fundamental component of almost any clinical application, and is used within an EHR to both enter and display patient health records. Record Services Record services are a set of services for managing patient health records. Record services provide functions like entering data into health records, searching for and retrieving health records, querying or extracting data from health records, and communicating or exchanging health records with other systems or applications. Record services interact with other components in this model such as the UI. Terminology Services Terminology services are those services that directly manage the terminology resources. They include functions like querying concepts, relationships and reference sets, and installing or updating SNOMED CT from release files. API Services Application Program Interface (API) services are a set of services for managing exchange of patient health record information with external parties. These services interface closely with terminology and record services to package information for export, and ingest and unpack incoming information for internal storage and utilization. Source https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCCDS/2.1.+EHR+System+Architecture Access and Regulatory Considerations Given the highly sensitive nature of data potentially contained within the EHR, significant regulatory and programmatic considerations come into play. To learn more about personally identifiable information (PII), protected health information (PHI), and The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), please expand the clipboards below. PII and PHI Information and Concerns Before potentially accessing EHR data, it is important to note that such information is considered highly sensitive and is subject to considerable safeguards. Specifically, much of the data contained within an EHR carries a legal designation of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and Protected Health Information (PHI). PII is information that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual's identity, either alone or when combined with other personal or identifying information that is linked or linkable to a specific individual. Source: Glossary of NIH Terms https://grants.nih.gov/grants/glossary.htm#P PHI is information that relates to: the individual\u2019s past, present or future physical or mental health or condition, the provision of health care to the individual, or the past, present, or future payment for the provision of health care to the individual, and that identifies the individual or for which there is a reasonable basis to believe it can be used to identify the individual. Individually identifiable health information includes many common identifiers (e.g., name, address, birth date, Social Security Number). Source: source: https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/laws-regulations/index.html It should be noted that often researchers will work with de-identified EHR data that has purposely been stripped of PII. This may negate specific privacy concerns but there are other, additional privacy protections and considerations for handling even de-identified data. There could also be privacy issues if multiple records of the same individual are linked together to create a more robust dataset. Read more about the privacy rule here: https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/privacysummary.pdf Read more about privacy and security of health information here: https://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/privacy/onc_privacy_and_security_chapter4_v1_022112.pdf HIPAA and other regulatory considerations The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), and the Standards for Privacy of Individually Identifiable Health Information (Privacy Rule) issued by the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to implement it, protects all \"individually identifiable health information\" held or transmitted by a covered entity or its business associate, in any form or media, whether electronic, paper, or oral. Source: Glossary of NIH Terms https://grants.nih.gov/grants/glossary.htm#H Several central tenets of the Privacy Rule are: In general, authorized healthcare professionals may use or disclose protected health information for the purposes of treatment, payment, and health care operations without obtaining a patient\u2019s written permission. For other purposes, including research, one may need to obtain an individual\u2019s authorization to use PHI. Accessing PHI from a third-party institution will likely require formalized business associate arrangement or data use agreements that must require all parties to comply with HIPAA, including breach notification requirements. Generally, access to, use of, and disclosure of protected health information must be kept to the minimum necessary to carry out an action. This is called the \u201cminimum necessary rule.\u201d Source: https://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/privacy/onc_privacy_and_security_chapter4_v1_022112.pdf There are also concerns about discrimination based on healthcare data that have resulted in regulatory protections. One such example is The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) of 2008 which protects Americans from discrimination based on their genetic information in both health insurance (Title I) and employment (Title II). Source: https://www.genome.gov/about-genomics/policy-issues/Genetic-Discrimination Data Composition The information contained in an EHR record can often be traced to a patient\u2019s flow through the medical system. While each patient encounter may vary drastically based on the encounter type and the severity of the patient\u2019s condition, we will explore the types of data in an EHR through the use-case of a typical annual wellness encounter (i.e., an annual patient visit to a primary care physician). To illustrate this scenario, this exercise references the \"Wellness Encounter\" from the Synthea Module Builder to show one possible process flow. The tool allows users to view and customize several possible health care scenarios, charting the process flow, and the associated data elements that come out of each step in the process\u200b. Source: https://synthetichealth.github.io/module-builder/#wellness_encounters Processes can vary drastically It should also be noted that these steps are not always a uniformly linear progression as patients may cycle back and forth through varying steps depending on their particular set of circumstances. We'll check out an example of a wellness encounter between a patient and their outpatient healthcare provider. Here we see the initialization of the wellness encounter with the patient receiving an initial screening. The Provider begins by recording the patient\u2019s height, which is captured as a Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINC) code (see details on LOINC below ). In this case, height is recorded with the LOINC code of 8302-2 which is Body Height . Next, the Provider inquires about the patient\u2019s current pain level and again records the result as a LOINC code. In this case, pain is recorded with the LOINC code of 72514-3 which has a human-readable description of Pain Severity - 0-10 verbal numerical rating [Score] - Reported . Further down in the process flow we find our provider inquiring about the patient\u2019s smoking status. Depending on the smoking status, we see that there are three options (in this example there are three, but more exist in the real world). All three options use the same LOINC code 72166-2 with the human-readable description of Tobacco smoking status -- but each option has a different value. The LOINC standard has a preferred answer list for this question, but here our example represents the answers with one of three Systemized Nomenclature of Medicine \u2013 Clinical Terms or SNOMED CT\u00ae codes ( learn more about SNOMED CT below ), one where the smoker attribute is true, the second where the quit smoking date is not null, and finally 3, an else default finding: SNOMED CT 449868002 with the human-readable description Smokes tobacco daily (finding) SNOMED CT 8517006 with the human-readable description Ex-smoker (finding) SNOMED CT 266919005 with the human-readable description Never smoked tobacco (finding) More generally, an EHR record will contain patient health information accumulated through this process, typically broken out by date, category, and information type. While the specific composition of this data can vary depending on EHR implementation, a reasonable example of data type and composition is available with the Synthea dataset. It can be helpful to explore example EHR records in further detail to better understand what information they contain. In lieu of access to actual PHI, the Synthea project can come in handy to view specific data fields and associated elements. Synthea, which has also produced the modeling tool we just used, is a Synthetic Patient Population Simulation that is used to generate synthetic patients. Synthea outputs synthetic, realistic (but not real) patient data and associated health records in a variety of formats. All the following screenshots are from Synthea, so remember, all data you\u2019ll be viewing is synthetic and contains no actual PII. To find out more about Synthea check here Synthea is a Synthetic Patient Population Simulation that is used to generate the synthetic patients. Synthea outputs synthetic, realistic (but not real) patient data and associated health records in a variety of formats. Access Synthea project datasets here: https://synthea.mitre.org/about Sample EHR Data Exercise The following exercise leverages synthetic data to explore some data elements contained in an EHR. First let's look at the overall schema. Synthea\u2019s EHR data is broken into a series of CSV files, each corresponding to a data table you might find in an EHR's relational database.

Some of these Encounters also have a REASONCODE. Both codes use SNOMED CT (see details on SNOMED CT below ). These are mainly used for diagnosis, procedure tracking, and symptom monitoring purposes within a healthcare setting. The better documented \"encounters\" can also provide a wealth of information retrospectively for understanding etiology of diseases or can be used for epidemiological studies (e.g., hospital acquired infections or infection control and containment). Patients also have a list of Conditions or Diagnoses.

Again, these examples use SNOMED CT codes, but other common terminologies include International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (Tenth Revision) (ICD-10). We can see from the descriptions that some of these codes are clinical diagnoses, such as Acute bronchitis, and Acute myeloid leukemia disease. However, some of these data points can also be Social Determinants of Health (SDoH) such as stress, limited social contact, and social isolation, such as the Risk activity involvement code above. During an Encounter, the clinical staff may perform Procedures on patients, which are recorded with CODEs. Some of these procedures also document a REASONCODE. These examples use SNOMED CT codes, but other common terminologies to encode procedures include Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) and Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS).

Yes An Observations table might look like the above. This table contains several different CATEGORIES of data, for example, vital-signs, laboratory, social-history, and survey data. Each data element has a CODE, description, value, and units of measure. In this example, the CODE is using LOINC, and the units of measure are using Unified Code for Units of Measure (UCUM). Note: Take a special look at one \u201csocial-history\u201d observation in the table that records a patient smoking status. We\u2019ll talk about this more when we discuss USCDI in the next section. In an EHR system, this structured data can be shown in a consolidated patient view (as opposed to a set of different tables). In an EHR, the patient record could also include unstructured clinical notes. A very rudimentary and abridged example of an unstructured clinical note may look like this: Cecil300 is a 50 year-old non-Hispanic white male. Patient has a history of acute bacterial sinusitis, part-time employment , limited social contact, reports of violence in the environment, social isolation, and stress. Patient is single. Patient is an active smoker and is an alcoholic. Patient identifies as heterosexual. Patient comes from a high socioeconomic background and has completed some college courses. Patient currently has coverage through Friendly Insurance Company. No Known Allergies. No Active Medications. Cecil300 presents to the office with a chief complaint of \"sore throat for one week.\" Patient reports that his sore throat began last Saturday, and has been getting worse since then. He reports that his throat is very sore and it hurts to swallow. He has also developed a fever of 101 degrees Fahrenheit and a headache. He denies any other symptoms, including cough, runny nose, or congestion. He reports that he has been taking ibuprofen and drinking lots of fluids, but his symptoms have not improved. So, now you\u2019ve seen some codes from different terminologies like SNOMED CT, LOINC, and RxNorm. You\u2019ve also seen some unstructured data as shown in the clinical note example. Let\u2019s dive a little deeper into these codes and terminologies in the next section. Codes and Medical Terminology When dealing with EHR data you will likely encounter two types: structured and unstructured. Unstructured data, typically taking the form of encounter notes, audio, video, or image files, has its own set of significant challenges, and will be out of scope for this tutorial. Structured data, in-contrast, is, as the name suggests, restricted to heavily formatted data types and structures. This could include text fields like name, regular-expressions, like phone number, and alpha-numeric coding terminology. Commonly used coding standards for structured data include: LOINC, CPT, SNOMED CT, ICD-10, and RxNorm, etc. \u200b It is important to have a general understanding of these coding systems because they have become the standard for rendering structured data in an interoperable manner. LOINC Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINC\u00ae) , is a proprietary clinical terminology that is important for laboratory test orders and results, and is one of a suite of designated standards for use in U.S. Federal Government systems for the electronic exchange of clinical health information. Managed by the Regenstrief Institute, LOINC has been identified by the Health Level 7 (HL7) Standards Development Organization as a preferred diagnostic report code set for laboratory test identification in transactions between health care facilities, laboratories, laboratory testing devices and public health authorities. See here: https://www.hl7.org/fhir/diagnosticreport-definitions.html#DiagnosticReport.code LOINC codes are divided into Order and Observation codes. LOINC Orders Structure and Examples LOINC codes are 5 digit numeric codes appended with a dash and 6th number. Form: XXXXX-X e.g., As an example, one of the more popular codes is: 2160-0 for Creatinine [Mass/volume] in Serum or Plasma Source: https://loinc.org/2160-0/ Additional attributes associated with LOINC test codes include: LOINC code Long Common Name Status *Additional names Class Type Order vs. Observation Member of these panels Member of these groups Example Units e.g., An example of a very common order is for a blood type test. https://loinc.org/34531-4/ and further details here https://loinc.org/kb/users-guide/introduction/ |LOINC code|Long Common Name|Status|Additional names|Class|Type|Order vs. Observation|Member of these panels|Member of these groups|Example Units| |----------|----------------|------|----------------|-----|----|---------------------|----------------------|----------------------|-------------| |34531-4|Blood type and Crossmatch panel - Blood|Active|Blood type and Crossmatch panel (Bld)| PANEL.BLDBK| Laboratory| Order|||| LOINC Result Code Structure and Examples LOINC Test Result codes are also 5 digit numeric codes appended with a dash and 6th number.

In this case: Answer Answer ID Group A LA19710-5 Group B LA19709-7 Group O LA19708-9 Group AB LA28449-9 Source: https://loinc.org/kb/users-guide/introduction/ Additional Resource on LOINC codes Additonal infomration on the LOINC coding terminology is available here: https://loinc.org Knowledge Check: Where would I look to find human-readable description of the specific LOINC code? The Long Common Name attribute provides the human-readable description for a specific LOINC code. CPT Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes are assigned to each task and service a healthcare provider offers. They include medical, surgical, and diagnostic services. Insurers use CPT codes to determine how much money to pay a provider for a given task or service. Code Similarities CPT codes are also a subset of codes comprising the Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) used for Medicare reimbursements. Source: https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Coding/MedHCPCSGenInfo CPT codes are developed, maintained, and copyrighted by the American Medical Association (AMA). CPT Code Structure and Examples A CPT code is a five-character code. Typically, most characters within the code are numbers without decimal marks. Some codes have four numbers and one letter. There are several categories of CPT codes, including: Category I: Procedures, services, devices, and drugs, including vaccines Category II: Performance measures and quality of care Category III: Services and procedures using emerging technology PLA codes, which are used for lab testing Here are some examples: 99214 may be used for an office visit 99397 may be used for a preventive exam if you are over 65 90658 indicates a flu shot 90716 may be used for the chickenpox vaccine (varicella) 12002 may be used when a healthcare provider stitches up a 1-inch cut on your arm It should also be noted that some CPT codes indicate bundled services. That is, one code describes several services performed together. Additional Resources on CPT codes Updated list of codes: https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Fraud-and-Abuse/PhysicianSelfReferral CPT code lookup tool: https://www.aapc.com/codes/cpt-codes-range/ SNOMED CT Systemized Nomenclature of Medicine \u2013 Clinical Terms or SNOMED CT\u00ae is a standardized, international, multilingual core set of clinical healthcare terminology that can be used in an EHR. SNOMED International is the non-profit standards development organization that creates and distributes SNOMED CT, and it is operated by the International Health Standards Development Organization. The National Library of Medicine (NLM) is the release center for SNOMED CT in the United States and supports the distribution of SNOMED CT for United States users. SNOMED CT is a critical part of interoperability SNOMED CT is one of a suite of designated standards for use in U.S. Federal Government systems for the electronic exchange of clinical health information and is also a required standard in interoperability specifications of the U.S. Healthcare Information Technology Standards Panel. SNOMED CT Code Structure and Examples SNOMED CT codes are numerical and are a minimum of six digits long. For instance, 271737000 is the code for anemia (disorder). A common procedural code is Renal dialysis (procedure) 265764009 . Additional Resource on SNOMED CT codes Resources and code lookups can be found here: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/healthit/snomedct/index.html ICD-10 ICD-10 is the 10th revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) , a medical classification list by the World Health Organization (WHO). For disease reporting, the US utilizes its own national variant of ICD-10 called the ICD-10 Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM). A procedural classification called ICD-10 Procedure Coding System (ICD-10-PCS) has also been developed for capturing inpatient procedures. The ICD-10-CM and ICD-10-PCS were developed by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). ICD-10 Code Structure and Examples ICD-10-CM codes may consist of up to seven digits, with the seventh digit extensions representing visit encounter or sequelae for injuries and external causes. source: https://www.aapc.com/icd-10/conversion-mapping.aspx Example codes: E08.22 , Diabetes mellitus due to an underlying condition with diabetic chronic kidney disease T81.535 , Perforation due to foreign body accidently left in body following heart catheterization Code extensions (seventh character) have been added for injuries and external causes to identify the encounter: initial, subsequent, or sequela. The extensions are: A Initial encounter D Subsequent encounter S Sequelae Additional Resources on ICD-10 codes https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Coding/ICD10 ICD-10 CM Browser from the CDC: https://icd10cmtool.cdc.gov ICD Browser from the World Health Organization: https://icd.who.int/browse10/2019/en RxNorm RxNorm is a normalized naming system for generic and branded drugs; it is a tool for supporting semantic interoperation between drug terminologies and pharmacy knowledge base systems. It does this by providing normalized names for clinical drugs and links its names to many of the drug vocabularies commonly used in pharmacy management and drug interaction software, including those of First Databank, Micromedex, and Gold Standard Drug Database. By providing links between these vocabularies, RxNorm can mediate messages between systems not using the same software and vocabulary. The National Library of Medicine (NLM) produces RxNorm. Source: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/rxnorm/overview.html RxNorm also provides a set of codes for clinical drugs, which are the combination of active ingredients, dose form, and strength of a drug. For example, the most prescribed drug in the US is Atorvastatin (also known as Lipitor, to 24M Americans) to lower cholesterol. Its RXNorm code is 83367 . Sources: https://clincalc.com/DrugStats/Drugs/Atorvastatin , https://mor.nlm.nih.gov/RxNav/search?searchBy=RXCUI&searchTerm=83367 In the National Drug Code (NDC) system, if more than one manufacturer produces the same medication, each assigns different NDCs. In contrast, the RxNorm vocabulary creates standard names and identifiers for the combinations of ingredients, strengths, and dose forms. Additional Resource on RxNorm codes https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/drug-naming-standard-electronic-health-records-enhanced Key Point: Why this matters: EHRs are a vast resource of information, chronicling each individual\u2019s health. Significant work has gone into standardizing this information into a uniform set of coding terminologies with the aim of ensuring that health records can be interpreted across providers and patients. Understanding these terminologies and the information types contained within them is a critical first step to unlocking the potential research value of this data.

EHRs are digital patient-centered records that make information securely available to authorized users. EHRs are intended to be operated by a healthcare practice or system and consolidate inputs by multiple providers within that system including physicians from differing specialties, nurses, and more that engage with a patient over the time they are receiving care. In an idealized implementation, an EHR may include all the key administrative clinical data relevant to that patient\u2019s care received through the health system. This includes demographics, progress notes, problems, medications, vital signs, past medical history, immunizations, laboratory data and radiology reports. These data may be in the form of both structured data (e.g., lab results) or unstructured data (e.g., clinical notes). In practice, even EHRs connected across hospital systems may not be well integrated, and information may not be harmonized. This situation can be made worse when an EHR system is customized in different settings (e.g., in different hospital systems, offices, etc.). Note Additionally, while initially a tool to facilitate electronic billing, an EHR system can increasingly go beyond standard clinical data collected in a provider\u2019s office and can be inclusive of a broader, patient-centric view of their care. This may include incorporating data from external care providers, as well as integrating with clinical decision support and other supplemental data sources to enhance an understanding of a patient\u2019s wellbeing.","title":"Overview of the EHR Technology Ecosystem"},{"location":"exercise-4/part-1/#ehr-technical-architecture","text":"To better understand the data elements contained in an EHR, it is important to understand the technical architecture of an EHR system. This section describes the major architectural components of an EHR system, and the interactions between these components. EHR System Component Description User Interface The user interface (UI) is a fundamental component of almost any clinical application, and is used within an EHR to both enter and display patient health records. Record Services Record services are a set of services for managing patient health records. Record services provide functions like entering data into health records, searching for and retrieving health records, querying or extracting data from health records, and communicating or exchanging health records with other systems or applications. Record services interact with other components in this model such as the UI. Terminology Services Terminology services are those services that directly manage the terminology resources. They include functions like querying concepts, relationships and reference sets, and installing or updating SNOMED CT from release files. API Services Application Program Interface (API) services are a set of services for managing exchange of patient health record information with external parties. These services interface closely with terminology and record services to package information for export, and ingest and unpack incoming information for internal storage and utilization.

To learn more about personally identifiable information (PII), protected health information (PHI), and The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), please expand the clipboards below. PII and PHI Information and Concerns Before potentially accessing EHR data, it is important to note that such information is considered highly sensitive and is subject to considerable safeguards. Specifically, much of the data contained within an EHR carries a legal designation of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and Protected Health Information (PHI). PII is information that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual's identity, either alone or when combined with other personal or identifying information that is linked or linkable to a specific individual. Source: Glossary of NIH Terms https://grants.nih.gov/grants/glossary.htm#P PHI is information that relates to: the individual\u2019s past, present or future physical or mental health or condition, the provision of health care to the individual, or the past, present, or future payment for the provision of health care to the individual, and that identifies the individual or for which there is a reasonable basis to believe it can be used to identify the individual. Individually identifiable health information includes many common identifiers (e.g., name, address, birth date, Social Security Number). Source: source: https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/laws-regulations/index.html It should be noted that often researchers will work with de-identified EHR data that has purposely been stripped of PII. This may negate specific privacy concerns but there are other, additional privacy protections and considerations for handling even de-identified data. There could also be privacy issues if multiple records of the same individual are linked together to create a more robust dataset.

Source: Glossary of NIH Terms https://grants.nih.gov/grants/glossary.htm#H Several central tenets of the Privacy Rule are: In general, authorized healthcare professionals may use or disclose protected health information for the purposes of treatment, payment, and health care operations without obtaining a patient\u2019s written permission. For other purposes, including research, one may need to obtain an individual\u2019s authorization to use PHI. Accessing PHI from a third-party institution will likely require formalized business associate arrangement or data use agreements that must require all parties to comply with HIPAA, including breach notification requirements. Generally, access to, use of, and disclosure of protected health information must be kept to the minimum necessary to carry out an action. This is called the \u201cminimum necessary rule.\u201d Source: https://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/privacy/onc_privacy_and_security_chapter4_v1_022112.pdf There are also concerns about discrimination based on healthcare data that have resulted in regulatory protections.

While each patient encounter may vary drastically based on the encounter type and the severity of the patient\u2019s condition, we will explore the types of data in an EHR through the use-case of a typical annual wellness encounter (i.e., an annual patient visit to a primary care physician). To illustrate this scenario, this exercise references the \"Wellness Encounter\" from the Synthea Module Builder to show one possible process flow. The tool allows users to view and customize several possible health care scenarios, charting the process flow, and the associated data elements that come out of each step in the process\u200b. Source: https://synthetichealth.github.io/module-builder/#wellness_encounters Processes can vary drastically It should also be noted that these steps are not always a uniformly linear progression as patients may cycle back and forth through varying steps depending on their particular set of circumstances. We'll check out an example of a wellness encounter between a patient and their outpatient healthcare provider. Here we see the initialization of the wellness encounter with the patient receiving an initial screening. The Provider begins by recording the patient\u2019s height, which is captured as a Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINC) code (see details on LOINC below ). In this case, height is recorded with the LOINC code of 8302-2 which is Body Height . Next, the Provider inquires about the patient\u2019s current pain level and again records the result as a LOINC code. In this case, pain is recorded with the LOINC code of 72514-3 which has a human-readable description of Pain Severity - 0-10 verbal numerical rating [Score] - Reported . Further down in the process flow we find our provider inquiring about the patient\u2019s smoking status. Depending on the smoking status, we see that there are three options (in this example there are three, but more exist in the real world). All three options use the same LOINC code 72166-2 with the human-readable description of Tobacco smoking status -- but each option has a different value. The LOINC standard has a preferred answer list for this question, but here our example represents the answers with one of three Systemized Nomenclature of Medicine \u2013 Clinical Terms or SNOMED CT\u00ae codes ( learn more about SNOMED CT below ), one where the smoker attribute is true, the second where the quit smoking date is not null, and finally 3, an else default finding: SNOMED CT 449868002 with the human-readable description Smokes tobacco daily (finding) SNOMED CT 8517006 with the human-readable description Ex-smoker (finding) SNOMED CT 266919005 with the human-readable description Never smoked tobacco (finding) More generally, an EHR record will contain patient health information accumulated through this process, typically broken out by date, category, and information type. While the specific composition of this data can vary depending on EHR implementation, a reasonable example of data type and composition is available with the Synthea dataset. It can be helpful to explore example EHR records in further detail to better understand what information they contain. In lieu of access to actual PHI, the Synthea project can come in handy to view specific data fields and associated elements. Synthea, which has also produced the modeling tool we just used, is a Synthetic Patient Population Simulation that is used to generate synthetic patients. Synthea outputs synthetic, realistic (but not real) patient data and associated health records in a variety of formats.

These are mainly used for diagnosis, procedure tracking, and symptom monitoring purposes within a healthcare setting. The better documented \"encounters\" can also provide a wealth of information retrospectively for understanding etiology of diseases or can be used for epidemiological studies (e.g., hospital acquired infections or infection control and containment).

Again, these examples use SNOMED CT codes, but other common terminologies include International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (Tenth Revision) (ICD-10). We can see from the descriptions that some of these codes are clinical diagnoses, such as Acute bronchitis, and Acute myeloid leukemia disease. However, some of these data points can also be Social Determinants of Health (SDoH) such as stress, limited social contact, and social isolation, such as the Risk activity involvement code above.

Yes An Observations table might look like the above. This table contains several different CATEGORIES of data, for example, vital-signs, laboratory, social-history, and survey data. Each data element has a CODE, description, value, and units of measure. In this example, the CODE is using LOINC, and the units of measure are using Unified Code for Units of Measure (UCUM). Note: Take a special look at one \u201csocial-history\u201d observation in the table that records a patient smoking status. We\u2019ll talk about this more when we discuss USCDI in the next section. In an EHR system, this structured data can be shown in a consolidated patient view (as opposed to a set of different tables). In an EHR, the patient record could also include unstructured clinical notes. A very rudimentary and abridged example of an unstructured clinical note may look like this: Cecil300 is a 50 year-old non-Hispanic white male. Patient has a history of acute bacterial sinusitis, part-time employment , limited social contact, reports of violence in the environment, social isolation, and stress. Patient is single. Patient is an active smoker and is an alcoholic. Patient identifies as heterosexual. Patient comes from a high socioeconomic background and has completed some college courses. Patient currently has coverage through Friendly Insurance Company. No Known Allergies. No Active Medications. Cecil300 presents to the office with a chief complaint of \"sore throat for one week.\" Patient reports that his sore throat began last Saturday, and has been getting worse since then. He reports that his throat is very sore and it hurts to swallow. He has also developed a fever of 101 degrees Fahrenheit and a headache. He denies any other symptoms, including cough, runny nose, or congestion. He reports that he has been taking ibuprofen and drinking lots of fluids, but his symptoms have not improved. So, now you\u2019ve seen some codes from different terminologies like SNOMED CT, LOINC, and RxNorm. You\u2019ve also seen some unstructured data as shown in the clinical note example.

The shift to value-based care (and reimbursement structures) fundamentally changed the way information needed to be exchanged between systems. Healthcare data interoperability is the vision that a patient could access their own medical records (or the records of their dependents), and that a patient's care team (including doctors and nurses) could access those records across provider organizations. Interoperability envisions a system in which data could be shared and exchanged with other providers to assist in an individual\u2019s care by providing a complete longitudinal record of care across providers, and enhance broader public health goals. Healthcare data interoperability has been an ongoing objective and is still not yet a fully realized goal. History of Regulation The Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) has been a critical driver of interoperability efforts. Learn more about ONC The Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) was created under the George W. Bush Administration in 2004. ONC is charged with synchronizing health IT in the U.S. health care sector. Source: https://www.techtarget.com/searchhealthit/definition/ONC . One of the first endeavors of ONC was the planning and design of a National Health Information Network (NHIN) to facilitate the exchange of electronic health information among providers and Health Information Exchange (HIE) entities. The continued vision is an interconnected healthcare ecosystem. For more information about ONC check here: https://www.healthit.gov/ Efforts at interoperability were accelerated by the passing of the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act More on the HITECH Act As part of the larger American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, the HITECH Act authorized CMS to establish the Medicare and Medicaid EHR Incentive Programs. These programs paid approximately $35 billion in incentive payments to eligible professionals, hospitals, and critical access hospitals to adopt, implement, upgrade, and demonstrate the use of certified EHR technology (CEHRT) that met certain standards for \u2018Meaningful Use\u2019 (MU). Source: https://hitconsultant.net/2013/04/11/history-of-healthcare-interoperability/ In 2011, the MU component of HITECH was implemented to expand the adoption of health information technology (HIT) and facilitate the use of EHRs. The reporting requirements for obtaining MU designation involved the ability of an EHR to perform such functions as generating problem lists, exchanging patient clinical data, or e-prescribing. Source: https://www.cms.gov/regulations-and-guidance/legislation/ehrincentiveprograms . The Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act (MACRA) of 2015 also was pivotal in advancing interoperability. Read more on MACRA here MACRA also served as a vehicle for Congress to declare a goal of achieving widespread exchange of health information through interoperable certified EHR technology by December 31, 2018. MACRA stated that there should be \u201cwidespread interoperability\u201d and established metrics to determine whether, and to what extent, objectives have been met by this time. Source: https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/2/text . Finally, in December of 2016, Congress passed the 21st Century Cures Act , which will require EHR systems to provide Patient and Clinician access to patient data encoded with USCDI and implemented with HL7 FHIR\u00ae and US Core. We'll talk about each of these topics in sequence. Read more on the CURES Act here The CURES Act revised a definition of interoperability with three characteristics: Enables the secure exchange of electronic health information with, and use of electronic health information from, other HIT without special effort on the part of the user; Allows for complete access, exchange, and use of all electronically accessible health information for authorized use under applicable state or federal law; and Does not constitute information blocking as defined in section 3022(a). Source: https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/34 Like MACRA, the 21st Century Cures Act mandated support for interoperable network exchange to be spearheaded by the ONC in collaboration with the National Institute of Standards and Technology and other divisions of HHS. This work included establishing and publishing details about a trusted exchange framework along with a directory of participating health information networks and rules for these networks to apply. More about the Cures Act final rule is available here: * https://www.healthit.gov/cures/sites/default/files/cures/2020-03/TheONCCuresActFinalRule.pdf * https://nexus.od.nih.gov/all/2020/07/31/leveraging-standardized-clinical-data-to-advance-discovery/ CURES Act's Impact for Researchers The Cures Act has been instrumental in increasing access to and interoperability of electronic health information for clinical care. This, in turn, has paved the way to leverage relevant policies, systems, and infrastructure to accelerate research. In parallel, researchers have been challenged to make data from a single research study, once collected, useful for other research endeavors. Data sharing is essential for expedited translation of research resources into human health improvements. Specifically, sharing scientific data and results enables researchers to more vigorously test the validity of research findings, strengthen analyses by combining data sets, and explore new frontiers. Source: https://nexus.od.nih.gov/all/2020/07/31/leveraging-standardized-clinical-data-to-advance-discovery/ The implementation of the Cures Act has laid the groundwork for increased use of health care data standards that can benefit research. How Healthcare Data Standards Support Interoperability It is often assumed that interoperability shortfalls are primarily due to the siloed nature of data within ecosystems. Although data blocking is a concern, most EHR vendors have met the minimum requirements for sharing information. However, evidence suggests that even though EHR vendors are meeting these minimum requirements, they are not facilitating the data exchanges to maximize the opportunities for interoperability. Previous research has shown that the complexity of facilitating exchange, lack of standards, and costs were the primary roadblocks vendors identified when asked to expedite interoperability solutions. To comply with the law, vendors would sometimes provide only the most basic information in PDF files for transfer, which are not interpretable or computable by other EHRs. Such transfers, while possibly meeting minimum compliance according to the letter of the law, should also be viewed as an element of data blocking. Source: www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/reports/info_blocking_040915.pdf Enabling Interoperability Therefore, to fully enable interoperability, significant work was required to create a uniform set of terminology standards and tools to facilitate the exchange of computable and interpretable health data. Ultimately, data sharing and interoperability will enable researchers to access billions of data points stored in EHRs to support their research, test the validity of findings, and/or strengthen analyses. This interoperability framework is extremely complex. Individual patient models must define all workflows for clinical care, step by step. The care models must be mapped out for every instance and option for care. Each element of these models must be translated into specific clinical definitions all providers agree to accept. Then, those definitions are assigned machine-readable terminologies from known standards held in recognized libraries such as SNOMED CT, or assigned LOINC and RxNorm codes. When appropriate, those terminologies also needed to be bound to a \"value set\" from the U.S. National Library of Medicine. A \"value set\" is a list of codes from one or more terminologies (e.g., SNOMED CT and ICD-10) that can be used for some purpose. That purpose could be to represent the same topic, or could be used to enumerate a list of clinical options, or something else entirely. Source: https://bulletin.facs.org/2017/11/a-history-of-health-information-technology-and-the-future-of-interoperability/ Introduction to USCDI Background and History Given this complexity, there existed a need for a framework to promote widespread interoperability. In the United States, the current set of health data standards used to define interoperability are the United States Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI) . USCDI is a standardized set of health data classes and constituent data elements for nationwide, interoperable health information exchange. It was adopted as a standard in the ONC Cures Act Final Rule . The USCDI sets a foundation for broader sharing of electronic health information to support patient care. The new rules require EHR implementation of the USCDI and Health Level Seven\u2019s (HL7\u00ae) Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR\u00ae) to support seamless and secure access, exchange, and use of electronic health information. As of Spring 2022, the currently released version is USCDI v2 which contains data classes and elements from USCDI v1 and new data classes and elements submitted through the ONC New Data Element and Class Submission System. Additional Resource on USCDI and V2 Source: https://www.healthit.gov/isa/sites/isa/files/2021-07/USCDI-Version-2-July-2021-Final.pdf Additionally, ONC released a Draft USCDI v3 and accepted feedback on its content through April 30, 2022. Additional Resources on USCDI Draft V3 To view a draft of V3 framework, please visit: https://www.healthit.gov/isa/sites/isa/files/2022-01/Draft-USCDI-Version-3-January-2022-Final.pdf Structure of the USCDI Standard The USCDI is a standardized set of overall health data classes (effectively aggregated category-types) and their constituent data elements for nationwide, interoperable health information exchange. USCDI Structure A USCDI \u201cData Class\u201d is an aggregation of various Data Elements by a common theme or use case. A USCDI \u201cData Element\u201d is the most granular level at which a piece of data is represented in the USCDI for exchange. For example, Date of Birth is a Data Element rather than its component Day, Month, or Year, because Date of Birth is the unit of exchange. Essentially, the USCDI elements are the basic healthcare data points that all modern healthcare systems and APIs are expected to support. The guiding USCDI principles, as set out by ONC, are to: Comprise a core set of structured and unstructured data needed to support patient care and facilitate patient access using health IT. Establish a consistent baseline of harmonized data elements that can be broadly reused across use cases, including those outside of patient care and patient access. Expand over time via predictable, transparent, and collaborative processes, weighing both anticipated benefits and industry-wide impacts. It should also be noted that USCDI also included Levels which denote the importance of certain data elements. The current USCDI levels are Comment (least important), 1, and 2 (most important).

The shift to value-based care (and reimbursement structures) fundamentally changed the way information needed to be exchanged between systems. Healthcare data interoperability is the vision that a patient could access their own medical records (or the records of their dependents), and that a patient's care team (including doctors and nurses) could access those records across provider organizations. Interoperability envisions a system in which data could be shared and exchanged with other providers to assist in an individual\u2019s care by providing a complete longitudinal record of care across providers, and enhance broader public health goals.

ONC is charged with synchronizing health IT in the U.S. health care sector. Source: https://www.techtarget.com/searchhealthit/definition/ONC . One of the first endeavors of ONC was the planning and design of a National Health Information Network (NHIN) to facilitate the exchange of electronic health information among providers and Health Information Exchange (HIE) entities. The continued vision is an interconnected healthcare ecosystem. For more information about ONC check here: https://www.healthit.gov/ Efforts at interoperability were accelerated by the passing of the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act More on the HITECH Act As part of the larger American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, the HITECH Act authorized CMS to establish the Medicare and Medicaid EHR Incentive Programs. These programs paid approximately $35 billion in incentive payments to eligible professionals, hospitals, and critical access hospitals to adopt, implement, upgrade, and demonstrate the use of certified EHR technology (CEHRT) that met certain standards for \u2018Meaningful Use\u2019 (MU). Source: https://hitconsultant.net/2013/04/11/history-of-healthcare-interoperability/ In 2011, the MU component of HITECH was implemented to expand the adoption of health information technology (HIT) and facilitate the use of EHRs. The reporting requirements for obtaining MU designation involved the ability of an EHR to perform such functions as generating problem lists, exchanging patient clinical data, or e-prescribing. Source: https://www.cms.gov/regulations-and-guidance/legislation/ehrincentiveprograms . The Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act (MACRA) of 2015 also was pivotal in advancing interoperability. Read more on MACRA here MACRA also served as a vehicle for Congress to declare a goal of achieving widespread exchange of health information through interoperable certified EHR technology by December 31, 2018. MACRA stated that there should be \u201cwidespread interoperability\u201d and established metrics to determine whether, and to what extent, objectives have been met by this time. Source: https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/2/text . Finally, in December of 2016, Congress passed the 21st Century Cures Act , which will require EHR systems to provide Patient and Clinician access to patient data encoded with USCDI and implemented with HL7 FHIR\u00ae and US Core. We'll talk about each of these topics in sequence. Read more on the CURES Act here The CURES Act revised a definition of interoperability with three characteristics: Enables the secure exchange of electronic health information with, and use of electronic health information from, other HIT without special effort on the part of the user; Allows for complete access, exchange, and use of all electronically accessible health information for authorized use under applicable state or federal law; and Does not constitute information blocking as defined in section 3022(a). Source: https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/34 Like MACRA, the 21st Century Cures Act mandated support for interoperable network exchange to be spearheaded by the ONC in collaboration with the National Institute of Standards and Technology and other divisions of HHS. This work included establishing and publishing details about a trusted exchange framework along with a directory of participating health information networks and rules for these networks to apply.

This, in turn, has paved the way to leverage relevant policies, systems, and infrastructure to accelerate research. In parallel, researchers have been challenged to make data from a single research study, once collected, useful for other research endeavors. Data sharing is essential for expedited translation of research resources into human health improvements. Specifically, sharing scientific data and results enables researchers to more vigorously test the validity of research findings, strengthen analyses by combining data sets, and explore new frontiers. Source: https://nexus.od.nih.gov/all/2020/07/31/leveraging-standardized-clinical-data-to-advance-discovery/ The implementation of the Cures Act has laid the groundwork for increased use of health care data standards that can benefit research.","title":"History of Regulation"},{"location":"exercise-4/part-2/#how-healthcare-data-standards-support-interoperability","text":"It is often assumed that interoperability shortfalls are primarily due to the siloed nature of data within ecosystems. Although data blocking is a concern, most EHR vendors have met the minimum requirements for sharing information. However, evidence suggests that even though EHR vendors are meeting these minimum requirements, they are not facilitating the data exchanges to maximize the opportunities for interoperability. Previous research has shown that the complexity of facilitating exchange, lack of standards, and costs were the primary roadblocks vendors identified when asked to expedite interoperability solutions. To comply with the law, vendors would sometimes provide only the most basic information in PDF files for transfer, which are not interpretable or computable by other EHRs. Such transfers, while possibly meeting minimum compliance according to the letter of the law, should also be viewed as an element of data blocking. Source: www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/reports/info_blocking_040915.pdf Enabling Interoperability Therefore, to fully enable interoperability, significant work was required to create a uniform set of terminology standards and tools to facilitate the exchange of computable and interpretable health data. Ultimately, data sharing and interoperability will enable researchers to access billions of data points stored in EHRs to support their research, test the validity of findings, and/or strengthen analyses. This interoperability framework is extremely complex. Individual patient models must define all workflows for clinical care, step by step. The care models must be mapped out for every instance and option for care. Each element of these models must be translated into specific clinical definitions all providers agree to accept. Then, those definitions are assigned machine-readable terminologies from known standards held in recognized libraries such as SNOMED CT, or assigned LOINC and RxNorm codes. When appropriate, those terminologies also needed to be bound to a \"value set\" from the U.S. National Library of Medicine. A \"value set\" is a list of codes from one or more terminologies (e.g., SNOMED CT and ICD-10) that can be used for some purpose. That purpose could be to represent the same topic, or could be used to enumerate a list of clinical options, or something else entirely.

More about FHIR\u00ae HL7 FHIR\u00ae is a robust and comprehensive standard, but for the purposes of this tutorial here is a very simplified view. FHIR\u00ae defines a set of Resources that can be exchanged. These Resources are structured data building blocks that group together commonly used and related data fields. Examples of Resources are things like Patient , Encounter , Condition , AllergyIntolerance , Medication , Procedure , and Observation . Some of these concepts should be familiar from Part 1.

Over time, more fields and optionality are added to the specification, gradually adding cost and complexity to the resulting implementations. The alternative is relying on custom extensions, but these create many implementation problems too. FHIR\u00ae solves this challenge by defining a simple framework for extending the existing resources to encompass new information and describe their use with Profiles. All systems that are FHIR-enabled can read all resources provided in a data exchange, but applications can add more control and meaning using profiles. Many healthcare contexts therefore require extensive local agreements. How FHIR\u00ae Adapts to the Diverse Array of Healthcare Data Requirements By its nature, FHIR\u00ae is designed to be both as comprehensive and expandable as possible to cover the widest range of health-related modalities. Its extensibility is a critical enabler for bringing in the widest possible array of potential use-cases and stakeholders into an interoperable health IT framework. The result of this, however, is that the potential exists for two health IT systems, even when both are on the FHIR\u00ae standard, to have vastly divergent sets of information available. Because of this, there exists a need for FHIR\u00ae standard guidelines that define the precise implementations of FHIR\u00ae a specific health IT system has deployed and supports. These guides have been formalized in FHIR\u00ae as Implementations Guides (IG) . An IG is a set of rules about how FHIR\u00ae resources are used (or should be used) to solve a particular problem, with associated documentation to support and clarify the usage. Source: http://hl7.org/fhir/implementationguide.html FHIR\u00ae IGs are typically published on the web after they are generated. For more information on the general process for IG creation, continue here FHIR\u00ae has a specific process for publishing IG available here: https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/IG+Publisher+Documentation FHIR\u00ae also includes the ImplementationGuide resource: a single resource that defines the logical structure of the content of the IG, so that the contents of the logical package that the IG represents are computable. In particular, validators are able to use the CapabilityStatement resource to validate content against the IG as a whole. The capability statement is a key part of the overall conformance framework in FHIR. It is used as a statement of the features of actual software, or of a set of rules for an application to provide. This statement connects to all the detailed statements of functionality, such as StructureDefinitions and ValueSets. This composite statement of application capability may be used for system compatibility testing, code generation, or as the basis for a conformance assessment. For further information about Conformance testing, see Conformance Rules and Profiling FHIR. More on this resource here: https://build.fhir.org/capabilitystatement.html FHIR\u00ae contains an official registry of IG available here: http://registry.fhir.org/ It should also be noted that while individual organizations and entities can develop their own IG, the development process should also be guided and supported by the HL7 community. US Core There are a variety of IGs available for FHIR\u00ae implementation. The US Core IG maps to the USCDI data standard, to help EHR systems meet Promoting Interoperability guidelines. The current, as of writing, version of the US Core IG (5.0.0) is based on FHIR\u00ae Version R4. Link for further info on FHIR\u00ae Version R4 Summary \u2013 FHIR\u00ae v4.0.1: https://www.hl7.org/fhir/summary.html The US Core IG defines the minimum set of constraints on the FHIR\u00ae resources to create the US Core Profiles. It also defines the minimum set of FHIR\u00ae RESTful interactions for each of the US Core Profiles to access patient data. By establishing the \u201cfloor\u201d of standards to promote interoperability and adoption through common implementation, it allows for further standards development evolution for specific uses cases.

Source: http://hl7.org/fhir/implementationguide.html FHIR\u00ae IGs are typically published on the web after they are generated. For more information on the general process for IG creation, continue here FHIR\u00ae has a specific process for publishing IG available here: https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/IG+Publisher+Documentation FHIR\u00ae also includes the ImplementationGuide resource: a single resource that defines the logical structure of the content of the IG, so that the contents of the logical package that the IG represents are computable. In particular, validators are able to use the CapabilityStatement resource to validate content against the IG as a whole. The capability statement is a key part of the overall conformance framework in FHIR. It is used as a statement of the features of actual software, or of a set of rules for an application to provide. This statement connects to all the detailed statements of functionality, such as StructureDefinitions and ValueSets. This composite statement of application capability may be used for system compatibility testing, code generation, or as the basis for a conformance assessment. For further information about Conformance testing, see Conformance Rules and Profiling FHIR. More on this resource here: https://build.fhir.org/capabilitystatement.html FHIR\u00ae contains an official registry of IG available here: http://registry.fhir.org/ It should also be noted that while individual organizations and entities can develop their own IG, the development process should also be guided and supported by the HL7 community.","title":"Introducing Implementation Guides"},{"location":"exercise-4/part-3/#us-core","text":"There are a variety of IGs available for FHIR\u00ae implementation. The US Core IG maps to the USCDI data standard, to help EHR systems meet Promoting Interoperability guidelines. The current, as of writing, version of the US Core IG (5.0.0) is based on FHIR\u00ae Version R4. Link for further info on FHIR\u00ae Version R4 Summary \u2013 FHIR\u00ae v4.0.1: https://www.hl7.org/fhir/summary.html The US Core IG defines the minimum set of constraints on the FHIR\u00ae resources to create the US Core Profiles. It also defines the minimum set of FHIR\u00ae RESTful interactions for each of the US Core Profiles to access patient data. By establishing the \u201cfloor\u201d of standards to promote interoperability and adoption through common implementation, it allows for further standards development evolution for specific uses cases.","title":"US Core"},{"location":"exercise-4/part-3/#specifics-of-the-us-core-ig-including-relationship-to-uscdi","text":"Let\u2019s take a closer look at how USCDI maps to US Core.

We can see details of the elements of the medication profile: http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/US-Core/StructureDefinition-us-core-medication.html Knowledge Check: Which element(s) of this profile must be supported in order to be US Core Compliant? Medication.code element Going back to our smoking example take a look here: http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/STU5/StructureDefinition-us-core-smokingstatus.html#mandatory-and-must-support-data-elements We can see here a list of required elements this profile must support. Knowledge Check: How many elements are required and what are they? 7 required elements. They include a status , a category slice, and then a specific category code of social-history , a code for smoking observation, a patient, when the observation occurred, a result value code for smoking status Knowledge Check: Where would I find the reference ID of the patient?

March 18, 2016 Knowledge Check: Is she a smoker and if so, what kind? Never smoker Additional Resources: Video from the HL7 FHIR\u00ae Connectathon features hands-on FHIR\u00ae development and testing. Implementers and developers can gain hands-on experience developing FHIR-based solutions by participating in one of many tracks. https://vimeo.com/542197402/8fb80fea04 Key Point: Why this matters: Researchers accessing data through the FHIR\u00ae standard are almost guaranteed to encounter novel implementations based on the particulars of the system they are accessing. The US Core IG, however, serves as a baseline researchers will be able to reference for United States-based EHR data. Familiarity with the US Core IG provides a foundational grasp of available data.","title":"IG navigation example by detailed US Core walkthrough"}]}
