# Part 3: Implementation Guides and US Core

## Background on FHIR
**The HL7® FHIR® (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) standard defines both the method and structure for HOW healthcare information can be exchanged between different systems regardless of how it is stored in those systems.**

It allows healthcare information, including clinical and administrative data, 
to be available securely to those who have a need to access it, and to those who have the right to do so for the benefit of a patient receiving care. 

The FHIR® standard is developed and maintained by the HL7® (Health Level Seven®) organization.

!!! note "Additional Information Available"
    Please note, NIH has created a webinar and associated interactive workshop focused specifically on the FHIR® standard.  
    (Once the Webinar and Workshop are fully released and available, this section will be updated to link to specific elements).

## How Implementation Guides (IG) are developed

### Introducing Implementation Guides
A principal challenge for healthcare standards is how to handle the wide variability caused by diverse healthcare processes. Over time, more fields and optionality are added to the specification, gradually adding cost and complexity to the resulting implementations. The alternative is relying on custom extensions, but these create many implementation problems too.

FHIR® solves this challenge by **defining a simple framework for extending the existing resources to encompass new information** and describe their use with Profiles. All systems that are FHIR-enabled can read all resources provided in a data exchange, but applications can add more control and meaning using profiles. 

Many healthcare contexts therefore require extensive local agreements.

!!! note "How FHIR® Adapts to the Diverse Array of Healthcare Data Requirements"
    By its nature, FHIR® is designed to be both as comprehensive and expandable as possible to cover the widest range of health-related modalities. Its extensibility is a critical enabler for bringing in the widest possible array of potential use-cases and stakeholders into an interoperable health IT framework.

The result of this, however, is that the potential exists for two health IT systems, **even when both are on the FHIR® standard, to have vastly divergent sets of information available.** Because of this, there exists a need for FHIR® standard guidelines that define the precise implementations of FHIR® a specific health IT system has deployed and supports. These guides have been formalized in FHIR® as **Implementations Guides (IG)**.

>An IG is a set of rules about how FHIR® resources are used (or should be used) to solve a particular problem, with associated documentation to support and clarify the usage.

FHIR® IGs are typically published on the web after they are generated.

??? note "For more information on the general process for IG creation, continue here"
    * FHIR® has a specific process for publishing IG available here: [https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/IG+Publisher+Documentation](https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/IG+Publisher+Documentation)

    * FHIR® also includes the `ImplementationGuide` resource: a single resource that defines the logical content of the IG, along with the important entry pages into the publication, so that the logical package that the IG represents, so that the contents are computable. 

    * In particular, validators are able to use the `CapabilityStatement` resource to validate content against the IG as a whole. The capability statement is a key part of the overall conformance framework in FHIR. It is used as a statement of the features of actual software, or of a set of rules for an application to provide. This statement connects to all the detailed statements of functionality, such as StructureDefinitions and ValueSets. This composite statement of application capability may be used for system compatibility testing, code generation, or as the basis for a conformance assessment. For further information about Conformance testing, see Conformance Rules and Profiling FHIR.
    More on this resource here: [https://build.fhir.org/capabilitystatement.html](https://build.fhir.org/capabilitystatement.html) 

It should also be noted that while individual organizations and entities can develop their own IG, the development process should also be guided and supported by the HL7 community.

## US Core 
So, if there are a variety of IGs available for FHIR® implementation, is there a particular one that maps to the USCDI data standard, one whose adoption would ensure that an EHR system fully met Promoting Interoperability guidelines?

> Yes! The US Core IG does exactly that.

The US Core IG is based on FHIR® Version R4 
> Link for further info: FHIR® Version R4 Summary - FHIR® v4.0.1 [https://www.hl7.org/fhir/summary.html](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/summary.html)) 
and defines the **minimum set of constraints on the FHIR® resources** to create the US Core Profiles. It also defines the **minimum set of FHIR® RESTful interactions** for each of the US Core Profiles to access patient data. By establishing the **“floor”** of standards to promote interoperability and adoption through common implementation, it allows for further standards development evolution for specific uses cases. 

### Specifics of the US Core IG including relationship to USCDI

Let’s take a closer look at how USCDI maps to US Core. The following table maps the relationship between the **USCDI v1 Summary of Data Classes and Data Elements**, it’s corresponding **US Core Profile**, and finally the associated **FHIR® Resource**. We can see the first few examples here:
![uscore_uscdi_mapping](img/uscore_uscdi_mapping.png)

The complete table is available here:
[https://www.hl7.org/fhir/us/core/general-guidance.html](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/us/core/general-guidance.html)

### Requirements and elements to be US Core compliant
The complete list of **US Core Profiles** is below. Each profile defines the minimum mandatory elements, extensions and terminology requirements that **MUST** be present to satisfy that profile. 

For each profile, requirements and guidance are given in a simple narrative summary.
??? Note "Complete list of US Core Profiles"
    * US Core AllergyIntolerance Profile
    * US Core BMI Profile
    * US Core Blood Pressure Profile
    * US Core Body Height Profile
    * US Core Body Temperature Profile

### IG navigation example by detailed US Core walkthrough

Let’s look specifically at the US Core Medication Profile here.
![uscore_medications](img/uscore_medications.png)

We can see details of the elements of the medication profile: [http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/US-Core/StructureDefinition-us-core-medication.html](http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/US-Core/StructureDefinition-us-core-medication.html)

??? question "Knowledge Check: Which element(s) of this profile must be supported in order to be US Core Compliant?"
    `Medication.code` element

Going back to our **smoking example** take a look here: HL7.FHIR.US.CORE\US Core Smoking Status Observation Profile - FHIR® v4.0.1 [https://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition-us-core-smokingstatus.html#:~:text=Resource%20Profile%3A%20US%20Core%20Smoking%20Status%20Observation%20Profile,as%20of%202019-05-21T00%3A00%3A00%2B00%3A00%20%204%20more%20rows%20](https://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition-us-core-smokingstatus.html#:~:text=Resource%20Profile%3A%20US%20Core%20Smoking%20Status%20Observation%20Profile,as%20of%202019-05-21T00%3A00%3A00%2B00%3A00%20%204%20more%20rows%20)

![Smoking core profile](img/smoking_core.png)

We can see here a list of required elements this profile must support.

??? question "Knowledge Check: How many elements are required and what are they?"
    7 required elements. They include a `status`, a category code of `social-history`, a code for smoking observation, a patient, when the observation occurred, a result value code for smoking status

??? question "Knowledge Check: Where would I find the reference ID of the patient?"
    `Subject code`

Let’s take a look at the raw unformatted **JSON code** for the resource:

!!! check "Key Point: Why this matters:"
    **Researchers accessing data made available through the FHIR® standard are almost guaranteed to encounter novel implementations based on the particulars of the system they are accessing. The US Core IG, however, serves as a foundational set of data researchers can almost always count on to be present. Knowing this IG will empower one to have a foundational grasp on any data accessed.**
