# Exercise 4

## Overview

This exercise was intended to augment [FHIR for Research Exercises 0-3](https://github.com/mitre/fhir-exercises) with a broad view of EHR, terminology systems, and how USCDI and Implementation Guides like US Core enable remote access and interoperability.

## Sections:

### Part 1: EHR Data

**Background:** As most healthcare-related data starts in Electronic Health Records (EHR) form, understanding EHR data and their research potential is a critical starting point.

**Learning Objectives:** Researchers understand the EHR as a potential source of data.

**Components:**

* Background
* Data Composition
  * What information is contained in an EHR record
  * Patient flow and associated data inuts
  * Codes and medical terminology
  * File-types

### Part 2: USCDI and Associated Terminology

**Background:** Knowing the origin of the data that researchers have to work with is the first step to understanding how to eventually access and utilize it. A next step is understanding the technical standards that enable remote access and interoperability.

**Learning Objective:** Researchers understand the concept of health data interoperability and USCDI.

**Components:**

* Background
  * Goals of healthcare data interoperability
  * Universal data standards and mapping approach
* USCDI
  * Background and history
  * Structure of Standard
  * Classes and Component Elements
  * Mapping USCDI to EHR data components
* USCDI and FHIR


### Part 3: Implementation Guides and US Core

**Background:** Introduce researchers to FHIR Implementation Guides and explain how these guides enable users to access data.

**Learning Objective:** Researchers undersatnd the role that Implementation Guides like US Core play in standardizing the precise data elements made available in specific FHIR-enabled data exchanges.

**Components:**

* Implementation Guides
  * Definition, components and documentation
  * How IGs are developed
  * How to examine and utilize an IG for research
  * IGs and the HL7 process
* US Core
  * Review specifics of the US Core IG including relationships to USCDI
  * Requirements and elements to be US Core compliant
  * IG navigation by example
