<h1 id="part-1-ehr-data">Part 1: EHR Data</h1>
<h2 id="overview-of-the-ehr-technology-ecosystem">Overview of the EHR Technology Ecosystem</h2>
<p><strong>At its core level, an electronic health record (EHR) is a digital version of a patient’s paper medical chart. EHRs are real-time, patient-centered records that make information available instantly and securely to authorized users.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>EHRs are intended to be operated by a healthcare practice or system and consolidate inputs by multiple providers within that system including physicians from differing specialties, nurses, and more that engage with a patient over the time they are receiving care.  </li>
<li>In an idealized implementation, an EHR may include all the key administrative clinical data relevant to that patient’s care received through the health system. This includes demographics, progress notes, problems, medications, vital signs, past medical history, immunizations, laboratory data and radiology reports. These data may be in the form of both structured data (e.g., lab results) or unstructured data (e.g., clinical notes). </li>
<li>It should be noted, however, that this is an idealized scenario.  In practice, even connected EHRs across hospital systems may not be truly connected, and information may not be harmonized.  It is even more problematic when an EHR system is deployed but customized in different settings (e.g., in different hospital systems, offices, etc.).  </li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Additionally, while initially a tool to facilitate electronic billing, an EHR system can increasingly go beyond standard clinical data collected in a provider’s office and can be inclusive of a broader, patient-centric view of their care. This may include incorporating data from external care providers, as well as integrating with clinical decision support and other supplemental data sources to enhance an understanding of a patient’s wellbeing.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="ehr-technical-architecture">EHR Technical Architecture</h3>
<p>To better understand the data elements contained in an EHR, it is important to understand the technical architecture of an EHR system. This section describes the major architectural components of an EHR system, and the interactions between these components.</p>
<p><img alt="EHR System Components" src="../img/ehr_system.png" /></p>

<h2 id="access-and-regulatory-considerations">Access and Regulatory Considerations</h2>
<p><strong>Given the highly sensitive nature of data potentially contained within EHR, significant regulatory and programmatic considerations come into play.</strong></p>
<p>If you're interested in learning more, check out below:</p>
<details class="abstract"><summary>PII and PHI Information and Concerns</summary><ul>
<li>Before potentially accessing EHR data, it is important to note that such information is considered highly sensitive and is subject to considerable safeguards. Specifically, much of the data contained within an EHR carries a legal designation of Personnally Identifiable Information (PII) and Protected Health Information (PHI).</li>
<li>PII is information that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual's identity, either alone or when combined with other personal or identifying information that is linked or linkable to a specific individual.<ul>
<li>Source: Glossary of NIH Terms <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/glossary.htm#P">https://grants.nih.gov/grants/glossary.htm#P</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Individually identifiable health information” is information, including demographic data, that relates to:<ul>
<li>the individual’s past, present or future physical or mental health or condition, </li>
<li>the provision of health care to the individual, or </li>
<li>the past, present, or future payment for the provision of health care to the individual, and that identifies the individual or for which there is a reasonable basis to believe it can be used to identify the individual.</li>
<li>Individually identifiable health information includes many common identifiers (e.g., name, address, birth date, Social Security Number).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It should be noted that often researchers will work with de-identified EHR data that has purposely been stripped of PII. This may negate specific privacy concerns but there are other, additional privacy protections and considerations for handling even de-identified data.</li>
<li>There could also be issues if Privacy Preserving Record Linkages are being made on the back end to allow for connections between different systems to identify the same individual to create a more robust dataset.</li>

<li>The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), and the Standards for Privacy of Individually Identifiable Health Information (Privacy Rule) issued by the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to implement it, protects all "individually identifiable health information" held or transmitted by a covered entity or its business associate, in any form or media, whether electronic, paper, or oral.
    Source: Glossary of NIH Terms <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/glossary.htm#H">https://grants.nih.gov/grants/glossary.htm#H</a></li>
<li>Several central tenets of the Privacy Rule are:<ul>
<li>In general, authorized healthcare professionals may use or disclose protected health information for the purposes of treatment, payment, and health care operations without obtaining a patient’s written permission.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For other purposes, including research, one may need to obtain an individual’s authorization to use PHI.</li>
<li>Accessing PHI from a third-party institution will likely require  formalized business associate arrangement or data use agreements that must require all parties to comply with HIPAA, including breach notification requirements.</li>
<li>Generally, access to, use of, and disclosure of protected health information must be kept to the minimum necessary to carry out an action. This is called the “minimum necessary rule.”</li>
<li>There are also concerns about discrimination based on healthcare data that have resulted in regulatory protections. One such example is The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) of 2008 which protects Americans from discrimination based on their genetic information in both health insurance (Title I) and employment (Title II).

<h2 id="data-composition">Data Composition</h2>
<p>The information contained in an EHR record can often be mapped to a patient’s flow through a medical system. While each patient encounter may vary dramatically based on the encounter type and the severity of the patient’s condition, the following tool can help us understand at least one possible process flow. The tool, a module builder, allows us to view and customize several possible health care scenarios, charting the process flow, and the associated data elements that come out of each step in the process​:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Source: <a href="https://synthetichealth.github.io/module-builder/#wellness_encounters">https://synthetichealth.github.io/module-builder/#wellness_encounters</a></p>
</blockquote>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Processes can vary dramatically</p>
<p>It should also be noted that these steps are not always a uniformly linear progression as patients may cycle back and forth through varying steps depending on their particular set of circumstances.</p>
</div>
<p>We'll check out an example of a wellness encounter between a patient and their outpatient healthcare provider. </p>
<p><img alt="wellness check" src="../img/wellness_encounter.png" /></p>
<p>Here we see the initialization of the wellness encounter with the patient receiving an initial screening.</p>
<p>The Provider begins by recording the patient’s height, which is captured as a Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINC) code (details on LOINC below)</p>
<p>Next, the Provider inquires about the patient’s current pain level and again records the result as a LOINC code.</p>
<p><img alt="wellness check" src="../img/encounter_smoking.png" /></p>
<p>Further down in the process flow we find our provider inquiring about the patient’s smoking status. Depending on the status we find one of three smoking LOINC status codes.</p>
<p>More generally, an EHR record will contain patient health information accumulated through this process, typically broken out by date, category, and information type. While the specific composition of this data can vary depending on EHR implementation, a good example of data type and composition is available with the Synthea dataset.</p>
<p>It can be helpful to explore example EHR records in further detail to better understand what information they contain. In lieu of access to actual PHI, the Synthea project can come in handy to view specific data fields and associated elements.</p>
<p>Synthea, which has also produced the modeling tool we just used, is a Synthetic Patient Population Simulation that is used to generate synthetic patients. Synthea outputs synthetic, realistic (but not real) patient data and associated health records in a variety of formats. All the following screenshots are from Synthea, so remember, all data you’ll be viewing is synthetic and contains no actual PII.</p>

<p>For example, in an EHR, we might view a list of patients as a table:</p>
<details class="abstract"><summary>Patients Table</summary><p><img alt="patients" src="../img/ehr_patients_1.png" /></p>
</details>
<p>We can see demographic data about these patients. Don’t worry, these are synthetic patients.</p>
<p>Each patient also has a list of Encounters (these are the visits) where they received care. For example:</p>
<details class="abstract"><summary>Encounters Table</summary><p><img alt="encounters" src="../img/encounters_2.png" /></p>
</details>
<p>In these examples, the Encounters have a CODE (a structured set of alpha-numeric patterns that map to detailed information such as diagnoses, procedures, etc.) with a corresponding description. Some of these Encounters also have a REASONCODE. Both codes use Systemized Nomenclature of Medicine – Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT) (which we will discuss shortly). These are mainly used for diagnosis, procedure tracking, symptoms, and for billing purposes within a healthcare setting.  The better documented "encounters" can also provide a wealth of information retrospectively for understanding etiology of diseases or can be used for epidemiological studies (e.g., hospital acquired infections or infection control and containment).</p>
<p>Patients also have a list of Conditions or Diagnoses. For example:</p>
<details class="abstract"><summary>Diagnoses Table</summary><p><img alt="diagnoses" src="../img/conditions_3.png" /></p>
</details>
<p>In these examples, we see each condition or diagnosis has a CODE. Again, these examples use SNOMED CT codes, but other common terminologies include International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (Tenth Revision) (ICD-10). We can see from the descriptions that some of these codes are clinical diagnoses, such as Hyperlipidemia, a history of Stroke, and Diabetic Retinopathy. However, some of these data points can also be Social Determinants of Health (SDoH) such as stress, limited social contact, and social isolation.</p>
<p>During an Encounter, the clinical staff may perform Procedures on patients, which are recorded with CODEs. Some of these procedures also document a REASONCODE. These examples use SNOMED CT codes, but other common terminologies to encode procedures include Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) and Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS).</p>
<details class="abstract"><summary>Procedures Table</summary><p><img alt="procedures" src="../img/procedures_4.png" /></p>
</details>
<p>Other common data elements include medications, either administered or prescribed, and diagnostic lab results and vital sign measurements. Sometimes the measurements and results are called Observations.</p>
<details class="abstract"><summary>Medications Table</summary><p><img alt="medications" src="../img/medications_5.png" /></p>
</details>
<p>These medications include information about the patient, a CODE, often the REASONCODE for the medication, the number of dispenses, and other information. In these examples, the CODEs used are RxNorm codes, and the REASONCODES are SNOMED CT.</p>
<details class="abstract"><summary>Observations Table</summary><p><img alt="observations" src="../img/observations_6.png" /></p>
</details>
<p>An Observations table might look like the above. This table contains several different CATEGORIES of data, for example, vital-signs, laboratory, social-history, and survey data. Each data element has a CODE, description, value, and units of measure. In this example, the CODE is using LOINC, and the units of measure are using Unified Code for Units of Measure (UCUM).</p>
<p>Take a special look at one “social-history” observation in the table that records a patient smoking status. We’ll talk about this more when we discuss USCDI in the next section.</p>
<p>Sometimes, this structured data can be shown a single patient view (as opposed to a set of different tables). Other times, the patient record could include unstructured clinical notes. A very rudimentary example of an unstructured clinical note may look like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cecil300 is a 50 year-old non-Hispanic white male. Patient has a history of acute bacterial sinusitis, part-time employment , limited social contact, reports of violence in the environment, social isolation, and stress. Patient is single. Patient is an active smoker and is an alcoholic. Patient identifies as heterosexual. Patient comes from a high socioeconomic background and has completed some college courses. Patient currently has coverage through Friendly Insurance Company. No Known Allergies. No Active Medications. Cecil300 presents to the office with a chief complaint of "sore throat for one week." Patient reports that his sore throat began last Saturday, and has been getting worse since then. He reports that his throat is very sore and it hurts to swallow. He has also developed a fever of 101 degrees Fahrenheit and a headache. He denies any other symptoms, including cough, runny nose, or congestion. He reports that he has been taking ibuprofen and drinking lots of fluids, but his symptoms have not improved.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, now you’ve seen some codes from different terminologies like SNOMED CT, LOINC, and RxNorm.  You’ve also seen some unstructured data as shown in the clinical note example. Let’s dive a little deeper into these codes and terminologies in the next section.</p>
<h2 id="codes-and-medical-terminology">Codes and Medical Terminology</h2>
<p><strong>When dealing with EHR data you will likely encounter two types: structured and unstructured. Unstructured data, typically taking the form of encounter notes, audio, video, or image files has its own set of significant challenges, and will be out of scope for this tutorial.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Unstructured data, typically taking the form of encounter notes, audio, video, or image files, has its own set of significant challenges, and will be out of scope for this tutorial.</li>
<li>Structured data, in-contrast, is, as the name suggests, restricted to heavily formatted data types and structures. This could include text fields like name, regular-expressions, like phone number, and alpha-numeric coding terminology. </li>
</ul>
<p>Commonly used coding standards for structured data include:  <strong>LOINC, CPT, SNOMED CT, ICD-10, and RxNorm, etc.</strong>​ It is important to have a general understanding of these coding systems because they have become the standard for rendering structured data in an interoperable manner.</p>
<h3 id="loinc">LOINC</h3>
<p><strong>Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINC®)</strong>, is a proprietary clinical terminology that is important for laboratory test orders and results, and is one of a suite of designated standards for use in U.S. Federal Government systems for the electronic exchange of clinical health information. </p>
<p>Managed by the Regenstrief Institute, LOINC has been identified by the Health Level 7 (HL7) Standards Development Organization as a preferred diagnostic report code set for laboratory test identification in transactions between health care facilities, laboratories, laboratory testing devices and public health authorities.</p>
<p>See here: <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/diagnosticreport-definitions.html#DiagnosticReport.code">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/diagnosticreport-definitions.html#DiagnosticReport.code</a></p>
<p>LOINC codes are dvidied into Test Order and Test Result codes.</p>
<details class="abstract"><summary>Test Order Code Structure and Examples</summary><p>Test Order codes are 5 digit numeric codes appended with a dash and 6th number. Form: XXXXX-X</p>
<p>e.g.,
    As an example, one of the more popular codes is: <code>2160-0</code> for <code>Creatinine [Mass/volume] in Serum or Plasma</code>

<h3 id="cpt">CPT</h3>
<p><strong>Current Procedural Terminology (CPT)</strong> codes are numbers assigned to each task and service a healthcare provider offers. They include medical, surgical, and diagnostic services. Insurers use CPT codes to determine how much money to pay a provider for a given task or service.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Code Similarities</p>
<p>CPT codes are also a subset of codes comprising the Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) used for Medicare reimbursements.</p>
</div>
<p>CPT codes are developed, maintained, and copyrighted by the American Medical Association (AMA).</p>
<details class="abstract"><summary>CPT Code Structure and Examples</summary><p>A CPT code is a five-digit numeric code. It has no decimal marks. Some have four numbers and one letter</p>
<p>There are several categories of CPT codes, including:</p>

<li><strong>Category II:</strong> Performance measures and quality of care</li>
<li><strong>Category III:</strong> Services and procedures using emerging technology</li>
<li>PLA codes, which are used for lab testing</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some examples:</p>

<h3 id="snomed">SNOMED</h3>
<p><strong>Systemized Nomenclature of Medicine – Clinical Terms or SNOMED CT®</strong> is a standardized, international, multilingual core set of clinical healthcare terminology that can be used in EHR.</p>
<p>SNOMED International is the non-profit standards development organization that creates and distributes SNOMED CT, and it is operated by the International Health Standards Development Organization. The National Library of Medicine (NLM) is the release center for SNOMED CT in the US and supports the distribution of SNOMED CT for US users.</p>

<h3 id="icd-10">ICD-10</h3>
<p>ICD-10 is the 10th revision of the <strong>International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD)</strong>, a medical classification list by the World Health Organization (WHO).</p>
<p>For disease reporting, the US utilizes its own national variant of ICD-10 called the ICD-10 Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM). A procedural classification called ICD-10 Procedure Coding System (ICD-10-PCS) has also been developed for capturing inpatient procedures. The ICD-10-CM and ICD-10-PCS were developed by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS).</p>
<details class="abstract"><summary>ICD-10 Code Structure and Examples</summary><p>ICD-10-CM codes may consist of up to seven digits, with the seventh digit extensions representing visit encounter or sequelae for injuries and external causes.</p>
<p><img alt="ICD-10 Format" src="../img/icd_10_format.png" /></p>
<p>Example codes:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>E08.22</code>, Diabetes mellitus due to an underlying condition with diabetic chronic kidney disease  </li>
<li><code>T81.535</code>, Perforation due to foreign body accidently left in body following heart catheterization  </li>
<li>Code extensions (seventh character) have been added for injuries and external causes to identify the encounter: initial, subsequent, or sequela. The extensions are:  <ul>
<li><code>A</code> Initial encounter  </li>
<li><code>D</code> Subsequent encounter  </li>

<h3 id="rxnorm">RxNorm</h3>
<p><strong>RxNorm</strong> RxNorm is a normalized naming system for generic and branded drugs; it is a tool for supporting semantic interoperation between drug terminologies and pharmacy knowledge base systems. </p>
<p>It does this by providing normalized names for clinical drugs and links its names to many of the drug vocabularies commonly used in pharmacy management and drug interaction software, including those of First Databank, Micromedex, and Gold Standard Drug Database. By providing links between these vocabularies, RxNorm can mediate messages between systems not using the same software and vocabulary.</p>
<p>The National Library of Medicine (NLM) produces RxNorm. Source: <a href="https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/rxnorm/overview.html">https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/rxnorm/overview.html</a></p>
<p>RxNorm also provides a set of codes for clinical drugs, which are the combination of active ingredients, dose form, and strength of a drug. </p>
<p>For example, the most prescribed drug in the US is <strong>Atorvastatin</strong> (also known as Lipitor, 24M Americans) to lower cholesterol. Its RXNorm code is <code>83367</code> sources: <a href="https://clincalc.com/DrugStats/Drugs/Atorvastatin">https://clincalc.com/DrugStats/Drugs/Atorvastatin</a>, <a href="https://mor.nlm.nih.gov/RxNav/search?searchBy=RXCUI&amp;searchTerm=83367">https://mor.nlm.nih.gov/RxNav/search?searchBy=RXCUI&amp;searchTerm=83367</a></p>
<p>In contrast to the National Drug Code (NDC) system, if more than one manufacturer produces the same medication, each assigns different NDCs. In contrast, the RxNorm vocabulary creates standard names and identifiers for the combinations of ingredients, strengths, and dose forms.</p>

<p><strong>EHR are a vast resource of information, chronicling an individual’s health. Significant work has gone into standardizing this information into a uniform set of coding terminologies that ultimately enable interoperability by ensuring that health records can be interpreted across providers and patients.
