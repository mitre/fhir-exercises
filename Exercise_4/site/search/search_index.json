EHRs are real-time, patient-centered records that make information available instantly and securely to authorized users. EHRs are intended to be operated by a healthcare practice or system and consolidate inputs by multiple providers within that system including physicians from differing specialties, nurses, and more that engage with a patient over the time they are receiving care. In an idealized implementation, an EHR may include all the key administrative clinical data relevant to that patient\u2019s care received through the health system. This includes demographics, progress notes, problems, medications, vital signs, past medical history, immunizations, laboratory data and radiology reports. These data may be in the form of both structured data (e.g., lab results) or unstructured data (e.g., clinical notes). It should be noted, however, that this is an idealized scenario. In practice, even connected EHRs across hospital systems may not be truly connected, and information may not be harmonized. It is even more problematic when an EHR system is deployed but customized in different settings (e.g., in different hospital systems, offices, etc.). Note Additionally, while initially a tool to facilitate electronic billing, an EHR system can increasingly go beyond standard clinical data collected in a provider\u2019s office and can be inclusive of a broader, patient-centric view of their care. This may include incorporating data from external care providers, as well as integrating with clinical decision support and other supplemental data sources to enhance an understanding of a patient\u2019s wellbeing. EHR Technical Architecture To better understand the data elements contained in an EHR, it is important to understand the technical architecture of an EHR system. This section describes the major architectural components of an EHR system, and the interactions between these components. Source https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCCDS/2.1.+EHR+System+Architecture Access and Regulatory Considerations Given the highly sensitive nature of data potentially contained within EHR, significant regulatory and programmatic considerations come into play. If you're interested in learning more, check out below: PII and PHI Information and Concerns Before potentially accessing EHR data, it is important to note that such information is considered highly sensitive and is subject to considerable safeguards. Specifically, much of the data contained within an EHR carries a legal designation of Personnally Identifiable Information (PII) and Protected Health Information (PHI). PII is information that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual's identity, either alone or when combined with other personal or identifying information that is linked or linkable to a specific individual. Source: Glossary of NIH Terms https://grants.nih.gov/grants/glossary.htm#P Individually identifiable health information\u201d is information, including demographic data, that relates to: the individual\u2019s past, present or future physical or mental health or condition, the provision of health care to the individual, or the past, present, or future payment for the provision of health care to the individual, and that identifies the individual or for which there is a reasonable basis to believe it can be used to identify the individual. Individually identifiable health information includes many common identifiers (e.g., name, address, birth date, Social Security Number). It should be noted that often researchers will work with de-identified EHR data that has purposely been stripped of PII. This may negate specific privacy concerns but there are other, additional privacy protections and considerations for handling even de-identified data. There could also be issues if Privacy Preserving Record Linkages are being made on the back end to allow for connections between different systems to identify the same individual to create a more robust dataset. Read more about the privacy rule here: https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/privacysummary.pdf https://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/privacy/onc_privacy_and_security_chapter4_v1_022112.pdf HIPAA and other regulatory considerations The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), and the Standards for Privacy of Individually Identifiable Health Information (Privacy Rule) issued by the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to implement it, protects all \"individually identifiable health information\" held or transmitted by a covered entity or its business associate, in any form or media, whether electronic, paper, or oral. Source: Glossary of NIH Terms https://grants.nih.gov/grants/glossary.htm#H Several central tenets of the Privacy Rule are: In general, authorized healthcare professionals may use or disclose protected health information for the purposes of treatment, payment, and health care operations without obtaining a patient\u2019s written permission. For other purposes, including research, one may need to obtain an individual\u2019s authorization to use PHI. Accessing PHI from a third-party institution will likely require formalized business associate arrangement or data use agreements that must require all parties to comply with HIPAA, including breach notification requirements. Generally, access to, use of, and disclosure of protected health information must be kept to the minimum necessary to carry out an action. This is called the \u201cminimum necessary rule.\u201d There are also concerns about discrimination based on healthcare data that have resulted in regulatory protections. One such example is The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) of 2008 which protects Americans from discrimination based on their genetic information in both health insurance (Title I) and employment (Title II). Source: https://www.genome.gov/about-genomics/policy-issues/Genetic-Discrimination Data Composition The information contained in an EHR record can often be mapped to a patient\u2019s flow through a medical system. While each patient encounter may vary dramatically based on the encounter type and the severity of the patient\u2019s condition, the following tool can help us understand at least one possible process flow. The tool, a module builder, allows us to view and customize several possible health care scenarios, charting the process flow, and the associated data elements that come out of each step in the process\u200b: Source: https://synthetichealth.github.io/module-builder/#wellness_encounters Processes can vary dramatically It should also be noted that these steps are not always a uniformly linear progression as patients may cycle back and forth through varying steps depending on their particular set of circumstances. We'll check out an example of a wellness encounter between a patient and their outpatient healthcare provider. Here we see the initialization of the wellness encounter with the patient receiving an initial screening. The Provider begins by recording the patient\u2019s height, which is captured as a Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINC) code (details on LOINC below) Next, the Provider inquires about the patient\u2019s current pain level and again records the result as a LOINC code. Further down in the process flow we find our provider inquiring about the patient\u2019s smoking status. Depending on the status we find one of three smoking LOINC status codes. More generally, an EHR record will contain patient health information accumulated through this process, typically broken out by date, category, and information type. While the specific composition of this data can vary depending on EHR implementation, a good example of data type and composition is available with the Synthea dataset. It can be helpful to explore example EHR records in further detail to better understand what information they contain. In lieu of access to actual PHI, the Synthea project can come in handy to view specific data fields and associated elements. Synthea, which has also produced the modeling tool we just used, is a Synthetic Patient Population Simulation that is used to generate synthetic patients. Synthea outputs synthetic, realistic (but not real) patient data and associated health records in a variety of formats. All the following screenshots are from Synthea, so remember, all data you\u2019ll be viewing is synthetic and contains no actual PII. To find out more about Synthea check here Synthea is a Synthetic Patient Population Simulation that is used to generate the synthetic patients. Synthea outputs synthetic, realistic (but not real) patient data and associated health records in a variety of formats. Access Synthea project datasets here: https://synthea.mitre.org/about Sample EHR Data Exercise The following exercise leverages Synthea data to explore sample data elements contained in an EHR First let's look at the overall schema. Synthea\u2019s EHR data is broken into a series of CSV files, each corresponding to a data table you might find in an EHR's relational database. If you want to see details on all available tables in Synthea check out the following: Synthea Data Tables and Descriptions File Description allergies.csv Patient allergy data careplans.csv Patient care plan data, including goals. claims.csv Patient claim data. claims_transactions.csv Transactions per line item per claim. conditions.csv Patient conditions or diagnoses. devices.csv Patient-affixed permanent and semi-permanent devices. encounters.csv Patient encounter data. imaging_studies.csv Patient imaging metadata. immunizations.csv Patient immunization data. medications.csv Patient medication data. observations.csv Patient observations including vital signs and lab reports. organizations.csv Provider organizations including hospitals. patients.csv Patient demographic data. payer_transitions.csv Payer Transition data (i.e. changes in health insurance). payers.csv Payer organization data. procedures.csv Patient procedure data including surgeries. providers.csv Clinicians that provide patient care. supplies.csv Supplies used in the provision of care. For example, in an EHR, we might view a list of patients as a table: Patients Table We can see demographic data about these patients. Don\u2019t worry, these are synthetic patients. Each patient also has a list of Encounters (these are the visits) where they received care. For example: Encounters Table In these examples, the Encounters have a CODE (a structured set of alpha-numeric patterns that map to detailed information such as diagnoses, procedures, etc.) with a corresponding description. Some of these Encounters also have a REASONCODE. Both codes use Systemized Nomenclature of Medicine \u2013 Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT) (which we will discuss shortly). These are mainly used for diagnosis, procedure tracking, symptoms, and for billing purposes within a healthcare setting. The better documented \"encounters\" can also provide a wealth of information retrospectively for understanding etiology of diseases or can be used for epidemiological studies (e.g., hospital acquired infections or infection control and containment). Patients also have a list of Conditions or Diagnoses. For example: Diagnoses Table In these examples, we see each condition or diagnosis has a CODE. Again, these examples use SNOMED CT codes, but other common terminologies include International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (Tenth Revision) (ICD-10). We can see from the descriptions that some of these codes are clinical diagnoses, such as Hyperlipidemia, a history of Stroke, and Diabetic Retinopathy. However, some of these data points can also be Social Determinants of Health (SDoH) such as stress, limited social contact, and social isolation. During an Encounter, the clinical staff may perform Procedures on patients, which are recorded with CODEs. Some of these procedures also document a REASONCODE. These examples use SNOMED CT codes, but other common terminologies to encode procedures include Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) and Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS). Procedures Table Other common data elements include medications, either administered or prescribed, and diagnostic lab results and vital sign measurements. Sometimes the measurements and results are called Observations. Medications Table These medications include information about the patient, a CODE, often the REASONCODE for the medication, the number of dispenses, and other information. In these examples, the CODEs used are RxNorm codes, and the REASONCODES are SNOMED CT. Observations Table An Observations table might look like the above. This table contains several different CATEGORIES of data, for example, vital-signs, laboratory, social-history, and survey data. Each data element has a CODE, description, value, and units of measure. In this example, the CODE is using LOINC, and the units of measure are using Unified Code for Units of Measure (UCUM). Take a special look at one \u201csocial-history\u201d observation in the table that records a patient smoking status. We\u2019ll talk about this more when we discuss USCDI in the next section. Sometimes, this structured data can be shown a single patient view (as opposed to a set of different tables). Other times, the patient record could include unstructured clinical notes. A very rudimentary example of an unstructured clinical note may look like this: Cecil300 is a 50 year-old non-Hispanic white male. Patient has a history of acute bacterial sinusitis, part-time employment , limited social contact, reports of violence in the environment, social isolation, and stress. Patient is single. Patient is an active smoker and is an alcoholic. Patient identifies as heterosexual. Patient comes from a high socioeconomic background and has completed some college courses. Patient currently has coverage through Friendly Insurance Company. No Known Allergies. No Active Medications. Cecil300 presents to the office with a chief complaint of \"sore throat for one week.\" Patient reports that his sore throat began last Saturday, and has been getting worse since then. He reports that his throat is very sore and it hurts to swallow. He has also developed a fever of 101 degrees Fahrenheit and a headache. He denies any other symptoms, including cough, runny nose, or congestion. He reports that he has been taking ibuprofen and drinking lots of fluids, but his symptoms have not improved. So, now you\u2019ve seen some codes from different terminologies like SNOMED CT, LOINC, and RxNorm. You\u2019ve also seen some unstructured data as shown in the clinical note example. Let\u2019s dive a little deeper into these codes and terminologies in the next section. Codes and Medical Terminology When dealing with EHR data you will likely encounter two types: structured and unstructured. Unstructured data, typically taking the form of encounter notes, audio, video, or image files has its own set of significant challenges, and will be out of scope for this tutorial. Unstructured data, typically taking the form of encounter notes, audio, video, or image files, has its own set of significant challenges, and will be out of scope for this tutorial. Structured data, in-contrast, is, as the name suggests, restricted to heavily formatted data types and structures. This could include text fields like name, regular-expressions, like phone number, and alpha-numeric coding terminology. Commonly used coding standards for structured data include: LOINC, CPT, SNOMED CT, ICD-10, and RxNorm, etc. \u200b It is important to have a general understanding of these coding systems because they have become the standard for rendering structured data in an interoperable manner. LOINC Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINC\u00ae) , is a proprietary clinical terminology that is important for laboratory test orders and results, and is one of a suite of designated standards for use in U.S. Federal Government systems for the electronic exchange of clinical health information. Managed by the Regenstrief Institute, LOINC has been identified by the Health Level 7 (HL7) Standards Development Organization as a preferred diagnostic report code set for laboratory test identification in transactions between health care facilities, laboratories, laboratory testing devices and public health authorities. See here: https://www.hl7.org/fhir/diagnosticreport-definitions.html#DiagnosticReport.code LOINC codes are dvidied into Test Order and Test Result codes. Test Order Code Structure and Examples Test Order codes are 5 digit numeric codes appended with a dash and 6th number. Form: XXXXX-X e.g., As an example, one of the more popular codes is: 2160-0 for Creatinine [Mass/volume] in Serum or Plasma Source: https://loinc.org/2160-0/ Additional attributes associated with LOINC test codes are: Test ID Test Order Name Order LOINC Code LOINC Attributes Method name e.g., An example can be found here: https://loinc.org/2160-0/ and https://loinc.org/kb/users-guide/introduction/ Test ID Test Order Name Order LOINC Code LOINC Attributes Method Name 10AIH Factor X Inhibitor Profile, Professional Interpretation 69049-5 Coagulation specialist review:Imp:Pt:XXX:Nar: Only orderable as a reflex. For more information see 10INE / Factor X Inhibitor Evaluation, Plasma. Medical Interpretation Test Result Code Structure and Examples LOINC Test Result codes are also 5 digit numeric codes appended with a dash and 6th number. Form: XXXXX-X Additional attributes associated with LOINC Test Result codes are: LOINC Values Updated Test ID Test Order Name Result ID Result LOINC Code LOINC Attributes Method Name LOINC Values Updated Test ID Test Order Name Result ID Test Result Name Result LOINC Code LOINC Attributes Method Name 2022-03-11 CNSA Central Nervous System Consultation, Autopsy, Varies 71070 Interpretation 18743-5 Autopsy report:Find:Pt:{Setting}:Doc:{Role} Includes hermatoxylin and eosin stains. Additional special stains or procedures necessary for diagnosis will be billed separately. For more information on LOINC codes Additonal infomration on the LOINC coding terminology is available here: https://loinc.org Knowledge Check: Where would I look to find details on the specific LOINC code? The Method name attribute provides additional details on the specific LOINC code. CPT Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes are numbers assigned to each task and service a healthcare provider offers. They include medical, surgical, and diagnostic services. Insurers use CPT codes to determine how much money to pay a provider for a given task or service. Code Similarities CPT codes are also a subset of codes comprising the Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) used for Medicare reimbursements. CPT codes are developed, maintained, and copyrighted by the American Medical Association (AMA). CPT Code Structure and Examples A CPT code is a five-digit numeric code. It has no decimal marks. Some have four numbers and one letter There are several categories of CPT codes, including: Category I: Procedures, services, devices, and drugs, including vaccines Category II: Performance measures and quality of care Category III: Services and procedures using emerging technology PLA codes, which are used for lab testing Here are some examples: 99214 may be used for an office visit 99397 may be used for a preventive exam if you are over 65 90658 indicates a flu shot 90716 may be used for the chickenpox vaccine (varicella) 12002 may be used when a healthcare provider stitches up a 1-inch cut on your arm It should also be noted that some CPT codes indicate bundled services. That is, one code describes several services performed together. For more information on CPT codes Updated list of codes: https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Fraud-and-Abuse/PhysicianSelfReferral CPT code lookup tool: https://www.aapc.com/codes/cpt-codes-range/ SNOMED Systemized Nomenclature of Medicine \u2013 Clinical Terms or SNOMED CT\u00ae is a standardized, international, multilingual core set of clinical healthcare terminology that can be used in EHR. SNOMED International is the non-profit standards development organization that creates and distributes SNOMED CT, and it is operated by the International Health Standards Development Organization. The National Library of Medicine (NLM) is the release center for SNOMED CT in the US and supports the distribution of SNOMED CT for US users. SNOMED CT is a critical part of interoperability SNOMED CT is one of a suite of designated standards for use in U.S. Federal Government systems for the electronic exchange of clinical health information and is also a required standard in interoperability specifications of the U.S. Healthcare Information Technology Standards Panel. SNOMED CT Code Structure and Examples SNOMED CT codes are numerical and are a minimum of six digits long. For instance, 271737000 is the code for anemia (disorder). A common procedural code is Renal dialysis (procedure) 265764009 . For more information on SNOMED CT codes Resources and code look ups here: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/healthit/snomedct/index.html ICD-10 ICD-10 is the 10th revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) , a medical classification list by the World Health Organization (WHO). For disease reporting, the US utilizes its own national variant of ICD-10 called the ICD-10 Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM). A procedural classification called ICD-10 Procedure Coding System (ICD-10-PCS) has also been developed for capturing inpatient procedures. The ICD-10-CM and ICD-10-PCS were developed by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). ICD-10 Code Structure and Examples ICD-10-CM codes may consist of up to seven digits, with the seventh digit extensions representing visit encounter or sequelae for injuries and external causes. Example codes: E08.22 , Diabetes mellitus due to an underlying condition with diabetic chronic kidney disease T81.535 , Perforation due to foreign body accidently left in body following heart catheterization Code extensions (seventh character) have been added for injuries and external causes to identify the encounter: initial, subsequent, or sequela. The extensions are: A Initial encounter D Subsequent encounter S Sequelae For more information on ICD-10 codes https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Coding/ICD10 https://www.icd10data.com RxNorm RxNorm RxNorm is a normalized naming system for generic and branded drugs; it is a tool for supporting semantic interoperation between drug terminologies and pharmacy knowledge base systems. It does this by providing normalized names for clinical drugs and links its names to many of the drug vocabularies commonly used in pharmacy management and drug interaction software, including those of First Databank, Micromedex, and Gold Standard Drug Database. By providing links between these vocabularies, RxNorm can mediate messages between systems not using the same software and vocabulary. The National Library of Medicine (NLM) produces RxNorm. Source: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/rxnorm/overview.html RxNorm also provides a set of codes for clinical drugs, which are the combination of active ingredients, dose form, and strength of a drug. For example, the most prescribed drug in the US is Atorvastatin (also known as Lipitor, 24M Americans) to lower cholesterol. Its RXNorm code is 83367 sources: https://clincalc.com/DrugStats/Drugs/Atorvastatin , https://mor.nlm.nih.gov/RxNav/search?searchBy=RXCUI&searchTerm=83367 In contrast to the National Drug Code (NDC) system, if more than one manufacturer produces the same medication, each assigns different NDCs. In contrast, the RxNorm vocabulary creates standard names and identifiers for the combinations of ingredients, strengths, and dose forms. For more information on RxNorm codes https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/drug-naming-standard-electronic-health-records-enhanced Key Point: Why this matters: EHR are a vast resource of information, chronicling an individual\u2019s health. Significant work has gone into standardizing this information into a uniform set of coding terminologies that ultimately enable interoperability by ensuring that health records can be interpreted across providers and patients. Understanding these terminologies and the information types contained within them is a critical first step to unlocking access to this data.

The tool, a module builder, allows us to view and customize several possible health care scenarios, charting the process flow, and the associated data elements that come out of each step in the process\u200b: Source: https://synthetichealth.github.io/module-builder/#wellness_encounters Processes can vary dramatically It should also be noted that these steps are not always a uniformly linear progression as patients may cycle back and forth through varying steps depending on their particular set of circumstances. We'll check out an example of a wellness encounter between a patient and their outpatient healthcare provider. Here we see the initialization of the wellness encounter with the patient receiving an initial screening. The Provider begins by recording the patient\u2019s height, which is captured as a Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINC) code (details on LOINC below) Next, the Provider inquires about the patient\u2019s current pain level and again records the result as a LOINC code. Further down in the process flow we find our provider inquiring about the patient\u2019s smoking status. Depending on the status we find one of three smoking LOINC status codes. More generally, an EHR record will contain patient health information accumulated through this process, typically broken out by date, category, and information type. While the specific composition of this data can vary depending on EHR implementation, a good example of data type and composition is available with the Synthea dataset. It can be helpful to explore example EHR records in further detail to better understand what information they contain. In lieu of access to actual PHI, the Synthea project can come in handy to view specific data fields and associated elements. Synthea, which has also produced the modeling tool we just used, is a Synthetic Patient Population Simulation that is used to generate synthetic patients. Synthea outputs synthetic, realistic (but not real) patient data and associated health records in a variety of formats.

Synthea\u2019s EHR data is broken into a series of CSV files, each corresponding to a data table you might find in an EHR's relational database. If you want to see details on all available tables in Synthea check out the following: Synthea Data Tables and Descriptions File Description allergies.csv Patient allergy data careplans.csv Patient care plan data, including goals. claims.csv Patient claim data. claims_transactions.csv Transactions per line item per claim. conditions.csv Patient conditions or diagnoses. devices.csv Patient-affixed permanent and semi-permanent devices. encounters.csv Patient encounter data. imaging_studies.csv Patient imaging metadata. immunizations.csv Patient immunization data. medications.csv Patient medication data. observations.csv Patient observations including vital signs and lab reports. organizations.csv Provider organizations including hospitals. patients.csv Patient demographic data. payer_transitions.csv Payer Transition data (i.e. changes in health insurance). payers.csv Payer organization data. procedures.csv Patient procedure data including surgeries. providers.csv Clinicians that provide patient care. supplies.csv Supplies used in the provision of care. For example, in an EHR, we might view a list of patients as a table: Patients Table We can see demographic data about these patients. Don\u2019t worry, these are synthetic patients. Each patient also has a list of Encounters (these are the visits) where they received care. For example: Encounters Table In these examples, the Encounters have a CODE (a structured set of alpha-numeric patterns that map to detailed information such as diagnoses, procedures, etc.) with a corresponding description. Some of these Encounters also have a REASONCODE. Both codes use Systemized Nomenclature of Medicine \u2013 Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT) (which we will discuss shortly). These are mainly used for diagnosis, procedure tracking, symptoms, and for billing purposes within a healthcare setting. The better documented \"encounters\" can also provide a wealth of information retrospectively for understanding etiology of diseases or can be used for epidemiological studies (e.g., hospital acquired infections or infection control and containment). Patients also have a list of Conditions or Diagnoses. For example: Diagnoses Table In these examples, we see each condition or diagnosis has a CODE. Again, these examples use SNOMED CT codes, but other common terminologies include International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (Tenth Revision) (ICD-10). We can see from the descriptions that some of these codes are clinical diagnoses, such as Hyperlipidemia, a history of Stroke, and Diabetic Retinopathy. However, some of these data points can also be Social Determinants of Health (SDoH) such as stress, limited social contact, and social isolation. During an Encounter, the clinical staff may perform Procedures on patients, which are recorded with CODEs. Some of these procedures also document a REASONCODE. These examples use SNOMED CT codes, but other common terminologies to encode procedures include Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) and Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS). Procedures Table Other common data elements include medications, either administered or prescribed, and diagnostic lab results and vital sign measurements. Sometimes the measurements and results are called Observations. Medications Table These medications include information about the patient, a CODE, often the REASONCODE for the medication, the number of dispenses, and other information. In these examples, the CODEs used are RxNorm codes, and the REASONCODES are SNOMED CT. Observations Table An Observations table might look like the above. This table contains several different CATEGORIES of data, for example, vital-signs, laboratory, social-history, and survey data. Each data element has a CODE, description, value, and units of measure. In this example, the CODE is using LOINC, and the units of measure are using Unified Code for Units of Measure (UCUM). Take a special look at one \u201csocial-history\u201d observation in the table that records a patient smoking status. We\u2019ll talk about this more when we discuss USCDI in the next section. Sometimes, this structured data can be shown a single patient view (as opposed to a set of different tables). Other times, the patient record could include unstructured clinical notes. A very rudimentary example of an unstructured clinical note may look like this: Cecil300 is a 50 year-old non-Hispanic white male. Patient has a history of acute bacterial sinusitis, part-time employment , limited social contact, reports of violence in the environment, social isolation, and stress. Patient is single. Patient is an active smoker and is an alcoholic. Patient identifies as heterosexual. Patient comes from a high socioeconomic background and has completed some college courses. Patient currently has coverage through Friendly Insurance Company. No Known Allergies. No Active Medications. Cecil300 presents to the office with a chief complaint of \"sore throat for one week.\" Patient reports that his sore throat began last Saturday, and has been getting worse since then. He reports that his throat is very sore and it hurts to swallow. He has also developed a fever of 101 degrees Fahrenheit and a headache. He denies any other symptoms, including cough, runny nose, or congestion. He reports that he has been taking ibuprofen and drinking lots of fluids, but his symptoms have not improved. So, now you\u2019ve seen some codes from different terminologies like SNOMED CT, LOINC, and RxNorm. You\u2019ve also seen some unstructured data as shown in the clinical note example. Let\u2019s dive a little deeper into these codes and terminologies in the next section.","title":"Sample EHR Data Exercise"},{"location":"part-1/#codes-and-medical-terminology","text":"When dealing with EHR data you will likely encounter two types: structured and unstructured.

The shift to value-based care (and reimbursement structures) fundamentally changed the way information needed to be exchanged between systems. Healthcare data interoperability is the vision that an individual patient (or their dependents) could access their own medical records, or that those records did not have to be siloed in a particular provider\u2019s ecosystem. Rather, interoperability envisions a system in which data could be shared and exchanged universally with other providers to assist in that individual\u2019s care by providing a complete longitudinal record of care across providers, and enhance broader public health goals. Healthcare data interoperability has been an ongoing and still not fully realized goal. History The Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) has been a critical driver of interoperability efforts.

ONC is charged with synchronizing health IT in the U.S. health care sector. Source: www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=61429 . One of the first endeavors of ONC was the planning and design of a National Health Information Network (NHIN) to facilitate the exchange of electronic health information among providers and Health Information Exchange (HIE) entities. The continued vision is an interconnected healthcare ecosystem. Efforts at interoperability were accelerated by the passing of the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act More on the HITECH Act As part of the larger American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. It authorized CMS to establish the Medicare and Medicaid EHR Incentive Programs. These programs paid approximately $35 billion in incentive payments to eligible professionals, hospitals, and critical access hospitals to adopt, implement, upgrade, and demonstrate the use of certified EHR technology (CEHRT) that met certain standards for \u2018Meaningful Use\u2019 (MU). Source: https://hitconsultant.net/2013/04/11/history-of-healthcare-interoperability/ In 2011, the MU component of HITECH was implemented to expand the adoption of health information technology (HIT) and facilitate the use of EHRs.

This work included establishing and publishing details about a trusted exchange framework along with a directory of participating health information networks and rules for these networks to apply. How Healthcare Data Standards Support Interoperability It is often assumed that interoperability shortfalls are primarily due to the siloed nature of data within ecosystems. Although data blocking is a concern, most EHR vendors have met the minimum requirements for sharing information. However, evidence suggests that even though EHR vendors are meeting these minimum requirements, they are not facilitating the data exchanges to maximize the opportunities for interoperability. Previous research has shown that the complexity of facilitating exchange, lack of standards, and costs were the primary roadblocks vendors offer when asked to expedite interoperability solutions. To comply with the law, vendors would sometimes provide even the most basic information in PDF files, which are not easily interpreted by other EHRs, for transfer. Such transfers, while possibly meeting minimum compliance with patient needs, should also be viewed as an element of data blocking. Source: www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/reports/info_blocking_040915.pdf Enabling Interoperability Therefore, to fully enable interoperability, significant work was required to create a uniform set of terminology standards and tools to facilitate the exchange of computable and interpretable health data. Ultimately, data sharing and interoperability will enable researchers to access billions of data points stored in EHRs to support their research, test the validity of findings, and/or strengthen analyses. This interoperability framework is extremely complex. Individual patient models must define all workflows for clinical care, step by step. The care models must be mapped out for every instance and option for care. Each element of these models must be translated into specific clinical definitions all providers agree to accept. Then, those definitions are assigned machine-readable terminologies from known standards held in recognized libraries such as SNOMED CT, and assigned LOINC and RxNorm codes. When appropriate, those terminologies also needed to be bound to a value set from the U.S. National Library of Medicine. Source: https://bulletin.facs.org/2017/11/a-history-of-health-information-technology-and-the-future-of-interoperability/ Introduction to USCDI Background and History The resulting framework came to be known as the United States Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI) . USCDI is a standardized set of health data classes and constituent data elements for nationwide, interoperable health information exchange. It was adopted as a standard in the ONC Cures Act Final Rule . The USCDI sets a foundation for broader sharing of electronic health information to support patient care. The new rules require EHR implementation of the USCDI and Health Level Seven\u2019s (HL7\u00ae) Fast Healthcare Information Resource (FHIR\u00ae) to support seamless and secure access, exchange, and use of electronic health information. Versions are updates to the USCDI standard. As of Spring 2022, the currently released version is USCDI v2 which contains data classes and elements from USCDI v1 and new data classes and elements submitted through the ONC New Data Element and Class Submission System. For more information on USCDI and V2 Source: https://www.healthit.gov/cures/sites/default/files/cures/2020-03/USCDI.pdf Additionally, ONC released a Draft USCDI v3 and accepted feedback on its content through April 30, 2022. For more information on USCDI Draft V3 To view a draft of V3 framework, please visit: https://www.healthit.gov/isa/sites/isa/files/2022-01/Draft-USCDI-Version-3-January-2022-Final.pdf Structure of the USCDI Standard The USCDI is a standardized set of overall health data classes (effectively aggregated category-types) and their constituent data elements for nationwide, interoperable health information exchange. USCDI Structure A USCDI \u201cData Class\u201d is an aggregation of various Data Elements by a common theme or use case. A USCDI \u201cData Element\u201d is the most granular level at which a piece of data is represented in the USCDI for exchange. For example, Date of Birth is a Data Element rather than its component Day, Month, or Year, because Date of Birth is the unit of exchange. Essentially, the USCDI elements are the basic healthcare data points that all modern healthcare systems and APIs are expected to support. The guiding USCDI principles, as set out by ONC, are to: Comprise a core set of structured and unstructured data needed to support patient care and facilitate patient access using health IT. Establish a consistent baseline of harmonized data elements that can be broadly reused across use cases, including those outside of patient care and patient access. Expand over time via predictable, transparent, and collaborative processes, weighing both anticipated benefits and industry-wide impacts. It should also be noted that USCDI also included Levels which denote the importance of certain data elements. The current USCDI levels are Comment (least important), 1, and 2 (most important).

USCDI and FHIR\u00ae We now want to better understand the connection between USCDI\u2019s data standard and the FHIR\u00ae standard for data exchange. Format and Structure While USCDI defined WHAT data elements are required for a core definition of comprehensive interoperability, it did not specify the precise format and structure for that data exchange, or the HOW . This would require the separate and complimentary adoption of the FHIR\u00ae standard explored further in the next part of this training exercise.

Previous research has shown that the complexity of facilitating exchange, lack of standards, and costs were the primary roadblocks vendors offer when asked to expedite interoperability solutions. To comply with the law, vendors would sometimes provide even the most basic information in PDF files, which are not easily interpreted by other EHRs, for transfer. Such transfers, while possibly meeting minimum compliance with patient needs, should also be viewed as an element of data blocking. Source: www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/reports/info_blocking_040915.pdf Enabling Interoperability Therefore, to fully enable interoperability, significant work was required to create a uniform set of terminology standards and tools to facilitate the exchange of computable and interpretable health data. Ultimately, data sharing and interoperability will enable researchers to access billions of data points stored in EHRs to support their research, test the validity of findings, and/or strengthen analyses. This interoperability framework is extremely complex. Individual patient models must define all workflows for clinical care, step by step. The care models must be mapped out for every instance and option for care. Each element of these models must be translated into specific clinical definitions all providers agree to accept. Then, those definitions are assigned machine-readable terminologies from known standards held in recognized libraries such as SNOMED CT, and assigned LOINC and RxNorm codes. When appropriate, those terminologies also needed to be bound to a value set from the U.S. National Library of Medicine.

USCDI Structure A USCDI \u201cData Class\u201d is an aggregation of various Data Elements by a common theme or use case. A USCDI \u201cData Element\u201d is the most granular level at which a piece of data is represented in the USCDI for exchange. For example, Date of Birth is a Data Element rather than its component Day, Month, or Year, because Date of Birth is the unit of exchange. Essentially, the USCDI elements are the basic healthcare data points that all modern healthcare systems and APIs are expected to support. The guiding USCDI principles, as set out by ONC, are to: Comprise a core set of structured and unstructured data needed to support patient care and facilitate patient access using health IT. Establish a consistent baseline of harmonized data elements that can be broadly reused across use cases, including those outside of patient care and patient access. Expand over time via predictable, transparent, and collaborative processes, weighing both anticipated benefits and industry-wide impacts. It should also be noted that USCDI also included Levels which denote the importance of certain data elements. The current USCDI levels are Comment (least important), 1, and 2 (most important).

It allows healthcare information, including clinical and administrative data, to be available securely to those who have a need to access it, and to those who have the right to do so for the benefit of a patient receiving care. The FHIR\u00ae standard is developed and maintained by the HL7\u00ae (Health Level Seven\u00ae) organization. More information and an overview can be found here: https://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/2019-08/ONCFHIRFSWhatIsFHIR.pdf Additional Information Available Please note, NIH has created a webinar and associated interactive workshop focused specifically on the FHIR\u00ae standard. (Once the Webinar and Workshop are fully released and available, this section will be updated to link to specific elements). How Implementation Guides (IG) are developed Introducing Implementation Guides A principal challenge for healthcare standards is how to handle the wide variability caused by diverse healthcare processes. Over time, more fields and optionality are added to the specification, gradually adding cost and complexity to the resulting implementations. The alternative is relying on custom extensions, but these create many implementation problems too. FHIR\u00ae solves this challenge by defining a simple framework for extending the existing resources to encompass new information and describe their use with Profiles. All systems that are FHIR-enabled can read all resources provided in a data exchange, but applications can add more control and meaning using profiles. Many healthcare contexts therefore require extensive local agreements. How FHIR\u00ae Adapts to the Diverse Array of Healthcare Data Requirements By its nature, FHIR\u00ae is designed to be both as comprehensive and expandable as possible to cover the widest range of health-related modalities. Its extensibility is a critical enabler for bringing in the widest possible array of potential use-cases and stakeholders into an interoperable health IT framework. The result of this, however, is that the potential exists for two health IT systems, even when both are on the FHIR\u00ae standard, to have vastly divergent sets of information available. Because of this, there exists a need for FHIR\u00ae standard guidelines that define the precise implementations of FHIR\u00ae a specific health IT system has deployed and supports. These guides have been formalized in FHIR\u00ae as Implementations Guides (IG) . An IG is a set of rules about how FHIR\u00ae resources are used (or should be used) to solve a particular problem, with associated documentation to support and clarify the usage. FHIR\u00ae IGs are typically published on the web after they are generated. For more information on the general process for IG creation, continue here FHIR\u00ae has a specific process for publishing IG available here: https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/IG+Publisher+Documentation FHIR\u00ae also includes the ImplementationGuide resource: a single resource that defines the logical content of the IG, along with the important entry pages into the publication, so that the logical package that the IG represents, so that the contents are computable. In particular, validators are able to use the CapabilityStatement resource to validate content against the IG as a whole. The capability statement is a key part of the overall conformance framework in FHIR. It is used as a statement of the features of actual software, or of a set of rules for an application to provide. This statement connects to all the detailed statements of functionality, such as StructureDefinitions and ValueSets. This composite statement of application capability may be used for system compatibility testing, code generation, or as the basis for a conformance assessment. For further information about Conformance testing, see Conformance Rules and Profiling FHIR. More on this resource here: https://build.fhir.org/capabilitystatement.html It should also be noted that while individual organizations and entities can develop their own IG, the development process should also be guided and supported by the HL7 community. US Core So, if there are a variety of IGs available for FHIR\u00ae implementation, is there a particular one that maps to the USCDI data standard, one whose adoption would ensure that an EHR system fully met Promoting Interoperability guidelines? Yes! The US Core IG does exactly that. The US Core IG is based on FHIR\u00ae Version R4 Link for further info: FHIR\u00ae Version R4 Summary - FHIR\u00ae v4.0.1 https://www.hl7.org/fhir/summary.html ) and defines the minimum set of constraints on the FHIR\u00ae resources to create the US Core Profiles. It also defines the minimum set of FHIR\u00ae RESTful interactions for each of the US Core Profiles to access patient data. By establishing the \u201cfloor\u201d of standards to promote interoperability and adoption through common implementation, it allows for further standards development evolution for specific uses cases. Specifics of the US Core IG including relationship to USCDI Let\u2019s take a closer look at how USCDI maps to US Core. The following table maps the relationship between the USCDI v1 Summary of Data Classes and Data Elements , it\u2019s corresponding US Core Profile , and finally the associated FHIR\u00ae Resource .
